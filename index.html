S. Ted Smallwood (Copeland Studies in Florida History)</h2><p>This book details the history of the area surrounding the small island town of Chokoloskee. Home to fishermen, outlaws and pioneers, the region was first occupied in the late 1870s (though not &#34;settled&#34; until the mid 20th century) and has a fascinating past. Central to the book is the memoir of Charles Sherod Ted&#34; Smallwood, a Chokoloskee pioneer whose general store was an outpost for supplies and a gathering point for area residents. Smallwood was present at the execution of outlaw Edgar J. Watson, suspected of murdering several area residents and the subject of Peter Mathiessen&#39;s best-selling trilogy of books &#34;Killing Mr. Watson,&#34; &#34;Lost Man&#39;s River&#34; and &#34;Bone by Bone.&#34;</p><p>Charlton W.

As they seek to reverse the inherited intellectual and moral heritage of the Bible,... [we are] engaged as never before in a rival conflict for the mind, the conscience, the will, the spirit, the very selfhood of contemporary man."</em> --Carl F. H. Henry</p> <p><em>Twilight of a Great Civilization</em> is a penetrating critique, by a distinguished Christian leader, of the moral and intellectual disintegration sweeping our culture. But more than this, it is a book of promise and possibilities--a ringing affirmation of the power of the gospel to transform hearts and minds, and to leave a lasting impact upon our age.</p> <p>As one of the noted Christian thinkers of this century, Carl F. H. Henry provides a perceptive diagnosis of America's spiritual malaise. From the decline in moral integrity, to "Christian Fundraising Heresies"; from the abandonment of rigorous education and clear thinking, to the affirmation of idealistic illusions in social and political matters--Henry shows how the wider culture, and many within Christian circles, have accommodated to the Spirit of the Age.</p> <p>But beyond the careful diagnosis lies Henry's prescription and vision for recovery: Jesus Christ the Lord is coming! He has won the ultimate victory over sin and death; and He will come again in power and glory to reign forevermore. Therefore, the church of Jesus Christ is alive!--and by the power of the Spirit is called to "march and sing our faith in the public arena, in the streets,... on the mass media," and in the marketplace of ideas.</p> <p>Henry provides here an invaluable resource to all who long for the light of Christ to shine with brilliance in this: "the twilight of a great civilization."</p> <p>"The American Century is over; the world order is changing. But America's eclipse is not inevitable. In a country where people can choose... , the future... is a matter of choice." --<em>Newsweek</em> Magazine</p> <p>"To the world we seem like Hogan's Army waiting for Godot. Can we take a holy initiative in history? Can we once more strike an apostolic stride? Can we put an ungodly world on the defensive again? Can we show men the folly of opposing Him who has already overcome the world, of rejecting fellowship with the coming King? Will we offer civilization a realistic option, or only a warning of impending doom? Will Christianity speak only to man's fears and frustrations, or will it also fill the vacuums in his heart and crown his longings for life at its best?" --Carl F. H. Henry</p></p><p></p><h2>History of Girly Magazines</h2><p>Pin-ups from the 19th century to the 1960s <p>It all started around 1900, and wouldn&#x2019;t you know the French were the first?

And some men find themselves thrust into the role of their nation's saviors. Such are the two heroes who reshaped and reconfigured the entire destiny of the kingdom of Scotland. Wallace the Braveheart would become the only legendary, heroic, commoner in medieval British history; the undying champion of the common man. The other, Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, would perfect the techniques of guerrilla warfare developed by Wallace and use them to create his own place in history as the greatest king of Scots.</p><p>In the spring of 1297, the two men meet in Ayr, in the south of Scotland, each having recently lost a young wife, one in childbirth and the other by murder. Each is heartbroken but determined in his grief to defy the ambitions of England and its malignant king, Edward Plantagenet, whose lust to conquer and consume the realm of Scotland is blatant and unyielding. Their combined anger at the injustices of the invading English is about to unleash a storm in Scotland that will last for sixteen years-and destroy England's military power for decades-before giving rise to a new nation of free men.</p></p><p>JACK WHYTE was born and raised in Scotland and has lived in Canada since 1967.

"The whole of China at our feets and all we takes be this barren, sodding rock."<br><br>He was standing on the foreshore with two of his fellow China traders. Scattered about them were other clusters of traders, and officers from the expeditionary force. They were all waiting for the Royal Navy officer to begin the ceremony. An honor guard of twenty marines was drawn up in two neat lines beside the flagpole, the scarlet of their uniforms a sudden splash of color. Near them were the untidy knots of sailors who had just fought the flagpole into the stony soil.<br><br>"Eight bells were time to raise the flag," Brock said, his voice rasping with impatience. "It be an hour past. Wot's godrotting delay for?"<br><br>"It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday, Mr. Brock," Jeff Cooper said. He was a lean, hook-nosed American from Boston, his frock coat black and his felt top hat set at a jaunty angle. "Very bad!"<br>Cooper's partner, Wilf Tillman, stiffened slightly, feeling the underlying edge to the younger man's nasal voice. He was thickset and ruddy, and came from Alabama.<br><br>"I'll tell thee right smartly, this whole godrotting flyspeck be bad joss!" Brock said. "Joss" was a Chinese word that meant Luck and Fate and God and the Devil combined. "Godrotting bad."<br><br>"It better not be, sir," Tillman said. "The future of the China trade's here now&#x2014;good joss or bad joss."<br><br>Brock stared down at him. "Hong Kong's got no future. It's open ports on the China mainland we be needing, and you knowed it, by God!"<br><br>"The harbor's the best in these waters," Cooper said. "Plenty of room to careen and refit all our ships. Plenty of room to build our homes and warehouses. And no Chinese interference at long last."<br><br>"A colony's got to have arable land and peasants to work the land, Mr. Cooper. An' revenue," Brock said impatiently. "I be walking all over and so have you. Not a crop'll grow here. There be no fields or streams, no grazing land. So no meat and no spuds. Everything we be needing'll have to come by sea. Think of the cost. Why, even the fishing be rotten. An' who's to pay upkeep of Hong Kong, eh? Us and our trade, by God!"<br><br>"Oh, that's the sort of colony you want, Mr. Brock?" Cooper said. "I thought the British Empire"&#x2014;he spat deftly to windward&#x2014;"had enough of that sort of colony."<br><br>Brock's hand strayed near his knife. "Be you spitting to clear yor throat, or spitting on the Empire?" Tyler Brock was nearing fifty, a big, one-eyed man as hard and as permanent as the iron he had been forced to peddle in Liverpool as a youth, and as strong and as dangerous as the fighting merchant ships he had escaped to and at length had come to rule as head of Brock and Sons. His clothes were rich and the knife at his belt was jeweled. His beard was graying like his hair.<br><br>"It's a cold day, Mr. Brock," Tillman said quickly, inwardly angry at his young partner's loose tongue. Brock was no man to bait, and they could not afford open enmity with him yet. "Plenty of chill on the wind, eh, Jeff?"<br><br>Cooper nodded briefly. But he did not take his eyes off Brock. He had no knife, but there was a derringer in his pocket. He was of a height with Brock but slighter, and unafraid.<br><br>"I be givin' thee piece of advice, Mr. Cooper," Brock said. "Best not spit too often after saying 'British Empire.' There be some wot baint be givin' thee benefit of doubt."<br><br>"Thank you, Mr. Brock, I'll remember," Cooper replied easily. "And I'll give you some advice: It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday."<br><br>Brock suppressed his temper. Eventually he would crush Cooper and Tillman and their company, the biggest of the American traders. But now he needed them as allies against Dirk and Robb Struan. Brock cursed joss. Joss had made Struan and Company the greatest house in Asia, and so rich and powerful that the other China traders had named it in awe and jealousy The Noble House&#x2014;noble because it was first in riches, first in largess, first in trade, first in clippers, but mostly because Dirk Struan was Tai-Pan, the Tai-Pan among all the tai-pans of Asia. And joss had cost Brock an eye seventeen years ago, the year that Struan had founded his empire.<br><br>It had happened off Chushan Island. Chushan was just south of the huge port of Shanghai, near the mouth of the mighty Yangtse River. Brock had beaten up through the monsoon with a huge cargo of opium&#x2014;Dirk Struan a few days astern, also carrying opium. Brock had reached Chushan first, sold his cargo and turned around, knowing happily that now Struan would have to go farther north and try a new coast with fresh risks. Brock had sped south for home&#x2014;Macao&#x2014;his coffers filled with bullion, the full wind astern. Then a great storm had suddenly swooped out of the China seas. The Chinese called these storms tai-fung, the Supreme Winds. The traders called them typhoons. They were terror incarnate.<br><br>The typhoon had battered Brock's ship mercilessly, and he had been pinned by the falling masts and spars. A shorn halyard, caught by the winds, had flailed him as he lay helpless. His men had cut him loose but not before the broken shackle-ended rope had gouged out his left eye. The ship had been on her beam ends and he helped them cut the rigging and spars adrift, and by some miracle she had righted herself. Then he had poured brandy into the bleeding socket; he could still remember the pain.<br><br>And he recalled how he had limped into port long after he had been given up for lost, his fine three-masted clipper no more than a hulk, the seams sprung, masts and guns and rigging gone. And by the time Brock had replaced spars and rigging and masts and cannon and powder and shot and men, and bought another cargo of opium, all the profits of this voyage had vanished.<br><br>Struan had run into the same typhoon in a small lorcha&#x2014;a boat with a Chinese hull, English-rigged and used for coastal smuggling in fine weather. But Struan rode out the storm and, elegant and untouched as usual, had been on the dock to greet Brock, his strange green eyes mocking him.<br><br>Dirk and his cursed joss, Brock thought. Joss be letting Dirk build that one stinking lorcha into a fleet of clippers and hundreds of lorchas, into warehouses and bullion to spare. Into godrotting Noble House. Joss pushed Brock and Sons into godrotting second place. Second. And, he thought, joss's given him ear of our godrotting weak-gutted plenipotentiary, the Honorable Godrotting Longstaff, all these years. An' now, together, they've sold us out. "A&nbsp; pox on Hong Kong and a pox on Struan!"<br>"If it weren't for Struan's plan, you'd never have won your war so easily," Cooper said.<br><br>The war had begun at Canton two years before, when the Chinese emperor, determined to bring the Europeans to heel, tried to eliminate the opium smuggling which was essential to British trade. Viceroy Ling had surrounded the foreign settlement at Canton with troops, and demanded every case of opium in Asia to ransom the lives of the defenseless English traders. At length, twenty thousand cases of opium had been given over and destroyed, and the British were allowed to retreat to Macao. But the British could not take lightly either interference with its trade or threats to its nationals. Six months ago the British Expeditionary Force had arrived in the Orient and ostensibly had been placed under the jurisdiction of Longstaff, the Captain Superintendent of Trade.<br><br>But it was Struan who conceived the inspired plan to by-pass Canton, where all the trouble had started, and instead send the expeditionary force north to Chushan. To take that island without loss would be simple, Struan had theorized, for the Chinese were unprepared and helpless against any modern European army or fleet. Leaving a small holding force at Chushan and a few ships to blockade the Yangtse, the expeditionary force could sail north to the mouth of the Pei Ho River and threaten Peking, the capital of China, which was only a hundred miles upstream. Struan knew that only so direct a threat would make the emperor immediately sue for peace. A superb conception. And it had worked brilliantly. The expeditionary force had arrived in the Orient last June. By July Chushan had been taken. By August it was moored at the Pei Ho. In two weeks the emperor had sent an official to negotiate peace&#x2014;the first time in history that any Chinese emperor had officially acknowledged any European nation. And the war had ended with almost no loss to either side.<br><br>"Longstaff was very wise to follow the plan," Cooper said.<br><br>"Any China trader knowed how to bring the Chinee to their knees," Brock said, his voice rough. He pushed his top hat farther back on his forehead and eased his eye patch. "But why did Longstaff and Struan agree to negotiate back at Canton, eh? Any fool knowed 'negotiate' to a Chinee means to play for time. We should've stayed north at the Pei Ho till peace were signed. But no, we brung back the fleet and for the last six month we be waiting and waiting for the buggers to set pen to paper." Brock spat. "Stupid, crazy stupid. An' all that waste of time and money for this stinking rock. We should've kept Chushan. Now, there be island worth having." Chushan was twenty miles long and ten wide and its land fertile and rich&#x2014;a good port and a big city, Tinghai. "Space for a man to breathe in there, right enough. Why, from there three or four frigates can blockade the Yangtse at the drop of a topper. An' who controls that river controls the heart of China. That's where we should settle, by God."<br><br>"You still have Chushan, Mr. Brock."<br><br>"Yus. But it baint deeded in godrotting treaty, so it baint our'n." He stamped his feet against the growing chill wind.<br><br>"Perhaps you should mention it to Longstaff," Cooper said. "He's susceptible to advice."<br><br>"Not to mine, he baint. As thee rightly knowed. But I'll tell thee, when Parliament hear about the treaty, there be hell to pay, I'll be bound."<br><br>Cooper lit a cheroot. "I'm inclined to agree. It is an astonishing piece of paper, Mr. Brock. For this day and age. When every European power is land-_grabbing and power-hungry."<br><br>"And I suppose the United States baint?" Brock's face tightened. "Wot about yor Indians? The Louisiana Purchase? Spanish Florida? You be havin' eyes on Mexico and Russian Alaska. The last mails told you be even trying to steal Canada. Eh?"<br><br>"Canada's American, not English. We're not going to war over Canada&#x2014;she'll join us of her own free will," Cooper said, hiding his worry. He tugged at his muttonchop whiskers and pulled his frock coat tighter around his shoulders against the sharpening wind. He knew that war with the British Empire would be disastrous at this time, and would ruin Cooper-Tillman. God damn wars. Even so, he knew that the States would have to go to war over Mexico and Canada unless there was a settlement. Just as Britain had had to go to war with China.<br><br>"There won't be a war," Tillman said, trying to quiet Cooper diplomatically. He sighed and wished himself back in Alabama. A man can be a gentleman there, he thought. There you don't have to deal with the damned British every day, or with blasphemous, foulmouthed scum like Brock, or a devil incarnate like Struan&#x2014;or even with an impetuous young man and senior partner like Jefferson Cooper, who thinks Boston the center of the earth. "And this war's over, for better or worse."<br><br>"Mark my words, Mr. Tillman," Brock said. "This godrotting treaty be no good for us'n and no good for they. We've to keep Chushan and open ports on mainland China. We be at war again in a few weeks. In June when the wind be ripe and the weather be ripe, the fleet'll have to sail north to Pei Ho again. An' if we be at war again, how we going to get season's teas and silks, eh? Last year almost no trade because of war&#x2014;the year before no trade at all an' they stole all our opium to boot. Eight thousand cases from me alone. Two million taels of silver that cost me. Cash."<br><br>"That money's not lost," Tillman said. "Longstaff ordered us to give it up. To ransom our lives. He gave us paper on the British Government. And there's a settlement in the treaty. Six million taels of silver to pay for it."<br><br>Brock laughed harshly. "Thee think Parliament be honoring Longstaff's paper? Why, any Government'd be throwed out of office the moment they asked for the brass to pay for opium. An' as to the six million&#x2014;that be paying for the cost of the war. I knowed Parliament better'n you. Kiss yor half million taels goodbye be my advice to you both. So if we be at war again this year, there be no trade again. An' if we baint trading this year, we be all bankrupt. You, me, every China trader. An' even the godrotting Noble House." He jerked out his watch. The ceremony was to have started an hour ago. Time be running out, he thought. Yus, but not on Brock and Sons, by God. Dirk's had seventeen-year run of good joss, and now be time for change.<br><br>Brock reveled in the thought of his second son, Morgan, who capably&#x2014;and ruthlessly&#x2014;controlled all their interests in England. He wondered if Morgan had been successful in undermining Struan's influence in Parliament and in banking circles. We be going to wreck thee, Dirk, he thought, and Hong Kong along with thee. "Wot the hell be the delay for?" he said, hastening toward the naval officer who was striding up and down near the marines.<br><br>"What's the matter with you, Jeff? You know he's right about Hong Kong," Tillman said. "You ought to know better than to bait him."<br><br>Cooper smiled his thin smile. "Brock's so goddam sure of himself. I couldn't help it."<br><br>"If Brock's right about the half million taels, we're ruined."<br><br>"Yes. But Struan will lose ten times that if there's no payment. He'll get paid, never fear. So we'll get ours." Cooper looked after Brock. "Do you think he knows about our deal with Struan?"<br><br>Tillman shrugged. "I don't know. But Brock's right about the treaty. It's stupid. It'll cost us a pretty penny."<br><br>For the last three months Cooper-Tillman had been acting as secret agents for The Noble House. British warships had been blockading Canton and the Pearl River, and British traders were forbidden to trade. Longstaff&#x2014;at Struan's bidding&#x2014;had put the embargo on as another measure to force the peace treaty, knowing that the Canton warehouses were bulging with teas and silks. But since America had not declared war on China, American ships could go through the blockade freely and thumb their noses at the warships. So Cooper-Tillman had bought four million pounds of tea from Chen-tse Jin Arn&#x2014;or Jin-qua, as he was nicknamed&#x2014;the richest of the Chinese merchants, and shipped it to Manila, supposedly for Spanish merchants. The local Spanish official, for a considerable bribe, had issued the necessary import and export licenses, and the tea was transferred&#x2014;duty free&#x2014;into Struan's clippers and rushed to England. Payment to Jin-qua was a shipload of opium delivered secretly by Struan somewhere up the coast.</p><h2>Transmission Arts: Artists and Airwaves (Art + Performance)</h2><p><p>Features 150 artists notable for their sonic, visual, and live works, spanning early radio experiments of the 1880s up to the present.

Son's story is deceptively simple: two young women in New York meet, talk about their boyfriends, feel a growing, unspoken attraction for each other, and finally kiss. And that one innocent kiss sets off a savage gay-bashing. But even as Stop Kiss confronts the reality of physical violence, Son's imaginative, moving, and surprising comedy brings audiences -- and her principal characters -- to unexpected places.<p>Callie is holding down a job as a radio traffic reporter when she meets Sara, a midwesterner who, against her parents' wishes, has moved to the city to teach third-grade students in the Bronx. Both have boyfriends, but as they get to know each other, their shared experiences and sense of humor create a strong bond. The tragic consequences of their kiss -- the center of this powerful drama -- serve as both an indictment of hatred and a moving study of the perils inherent in living life fully.</p></p><p>It doesn't do this play justice to say that much of the action takes place in a hospital room around the bed of a comatose woman. On the other hand, it may explain why critics have been so impressed. From unpromising material--standard urban settings, stilted exchanges, missed cues, private jokes, half-finished sentences--Diana Son has crafted a subtle, moving drama about vulnerability and risk. When Callie, a twentysomething New York traffic reporter, promises to take on a cat owned by Sara, "some friend of an old friend of someone," she arranges to leave quickly after Sara drops off the cat so that she doesn't get drawn into a dull evening with a stranger. Callie is an expert at avoiding conflict, which serves her well in the city. Sara, on the other hand, has willingly left her job at a Quaker school in St. Louis to teach third-graders in the Bronx. Although both are "straight" women, they circle each other warily, nursing an unspoken attraction. The playwright's choice to shuttle back and forth in time, between the hospital room and police station and the early days of Callie and Sara's friendship, lends a bittersweet quality to even their lightest exchanges, allowing us to wonder, along with the two women, whether the violent outcome of their single kiss makes it a bad idea. <i>Stop Kiss</i> revises <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, with one thug and the mores of a nation standing in for the family feud. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p><h2>Dr Johnson&#39;s London</h2><p><p><b>'A Baedeker of the past, absorbing and revealing in equal measure' Peter Ackroyd</b><br><b>'Brings the age's tortuous splendours and profound murkiness vividly to life' <i>Observer</i></b></p><p>When Dr Johnson published his great <i>Dictionary </i>in 1755, London was the biggest city in Europe.

Now, in The Book of Five Rings for Executives , Donald Krause has enriched and simplified the original material of this ancient classic of competitive tactics and strategy into a set of seven clearly defined and easily applied business principles.</p><p><i>The Book of Five Rings for Executives</i>, by international management consultant Donald G. Krause, is his third volume on classic battle philosophies that can help today's businesspeople compete more effectively. Based on an epic five-part letter to students written in 1643 by legendary samurai swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, the book has enthusiastically transplanted long-revered instructions in the martial arts from the Eastern battlefield to the Western boardroom. Musashi's stirring but difficult original treatise on "achieving competitive dominance" is given a more digestible update here by Krause, who shrewdly reorients its fundamental "five rings" into a set of seven practical principles centered on the requisite modern traits of preparation, discipline, skill, and fluidity. Along the way, he demonstrates how historical leaders such as George Washington and Lawrence of Arabia, in addition to contemporaries like Bill Gates and Howard Schultz, have embraced Musashi's ideas. The combination ultimately creates, as Krause explains, "a competitive sword which is capable of winning in all phases of business." <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Donald G. Krause is the author of the highly successful The Art of War for Executives and The Way of the Leader: The Leadership Principles of Sun Tzu and Confucius (both published by Nicholas Brealey Publishing and FT Bestsellers).

What can Richard III&#x2019;s furious sense of his own helplessness tell us of our own desires? <i>On Balance </i>shows Phillips&#x2019;s bravura gift for linking disparate ideas and the dreamers that dreamed them into something beautiful, revelatory, and essential.</p><p>Adam Phillips is a psychoanalyst and and a visiting professor in the English department at the University of York.

We tend to become either extremely disapproving or unusually enthusiastic and excited about the most recently reported celebrity orgy, or managing director&#x2019;s pay rise. No one can be indifferent to binge drinking, or the amount of pornography on the internet; everyone knows someone now who has a so-called eating disorder, and everyone knows about the huge numbers of people in the world who are starving. Excess is everywhere now &#x2013; excesses of wealth and of poverty, of sex and greed, of violence and of religious belief. If the twentieth century was, in the title of historian Eric Hobsbawm&#x2019;s book, The Age of Extremes, then the twenty-first century looks like being the Age of Excess. When people are being extreme they push things to their limits; when they are being excessive they push things beyond their limits.I want here to explore our fear and loathing, our fascination and craving for excess in all its forms. And I want to bear in mind something very strange about excess, something best pictured perhaps by the extraordinary consumerism of Western societies, or by the religious and anti-religious fanaticism in contemporary culture; and that is that excess is contagious. Nothing makes people more excessive than talking about excess.Like a lot of the words we use very easily, &#x2018;excess&#x2019; is older than we imagine. The Oxford English Dictionary dates its earliest, most literal meaning of &#x2018;the action of going out or forth&#x2019; to the fifteenth century; &#x2018;excess&#x2019;, in its original use, being the opposite of &#x2018;access&#x2019;. And this, too, I think is something we should bear in mind: access, if you like, is the freedom to go in; excess is the freedom to go out. But when we are excessive what are we going out from?Here, again, the dictionary can help us, and this time into more familiar territory: when we are excessive we &#x2018;depart from custom [or] reason&#x2019;, we &#x2018;overstep&#x2019; limits, we go beyond our &#x2018;rights&#x2019;; we are involved in what the dictionary calls &#x2018;extravagant violation of law, decency or morality&#x2019;, we are guilty of &#x2018;outrageous conduct&#x2019;. When we are excessive, in whatever way, we depart from what is considered appropriate behaviour; we go out from, we abandon, the version of ourselves we are supposed to be. And where do we get our standards of appropriate behaviour, our pictures of ourselves as we are supposed to be? From the societies we grow up in. Excess, the dictionary reminds us, is not simply the violation of law, decency or morality, it is the &#x2018;extravagant violation of law, decency or morality&#x2019;. So excess covers a whole gamut of experiences from exaggeration to breaking the law, from boasting to genocide. The anorexic and the suicide bomber, the attention-seeking child and the compulsive gambler, the person who has more money than he needs and the person committed to celibacy are all involved, in their different ways, in extravagant violations of law, decency or morality; even though, of course, they may not see it this way. And this, too, is important when we are thinking about excess: what is excessive to one person may be to another person just an ordinary way of life. The devoutly religious are not, in their own view, over-doing it; terrorists are not, in their view, overreacting to the injustices they feel they have suffered. Indeed, one of the ways of describing many of our personal and political and religious conflicts is that someone is trying to persuade someone else that they are being excessive: excessively cruel, excessively disrespectful, excessively unjust. So we need to remember just how much can hang on our definitions of excess. I want to consider here what might make us feel, in any given situation, that someone is being excessive; and what, when we feel people are being excessive, we want to do about it. Our knee-jerk reaction is often to want to punish them, and often excessively. And yet people usually punish each other when they don&#x2019;t know what else to do; which is why punishment is so often beside the point, an excited failure of imagination. Punishment is despair about the rules, not their enforcement. So it isn&#x2019;t just that excess is contagious, but that other people&#x2019;s excess permits us, or even frees us, to be excessive ourselves. Our reactions to other people&#x2019;s excesses &#x2013; of violence, of appetite, of belief &#x2013; are, as we shall see, extremely revealing. &#x2018;All truths,&#x2019; the philosopher Alain Badiou writes, &#x2018;are woven from extreme consequences.&#x2019; There are also truths woven from excessive consequences.But perhaps one thing we shouldn&#x2019;t lose sight of is just how reassuring the whole idea of excess can be; when we are not permitted to take excess baggage on the plane it is because somebody is keeping an eye on our safety, somebody knows how much the plane can take. In other words, what is reassuring about the idea of excess &#x2013; about our being able to think that someone is being excessive &#x2013; is that it implies that we know our limits, that we have a sure sense of the proper way to behave, that we know what is appropriate and right. Every time we have the moralistic version of the excess experience &#x2013; the righteous indignation, or rage, or grief about the transgressions of other people &#x2013; we relocate ourselves, firmly and safely, within the rules, the protective walls, of our societies. In these moments we are reminded of how the world should be, and that someone who knows the rules and can enforce them is looking after us. The child who has a tantrum is trying to find out if his parents are robust, whether they can withstand his hatred and rage and frustration. In this instance excessive behaviour is an opportunity for the parents to remind themselves, or for society to remind itself, of established rules and regulations. It reassures us to see that we clearly know what the rules are because we are outraged when they are broken.If we are so good at spotting excessive behaviour when we see it &#x2013; excessive eating, excessive sex, excessive shopping, the excessive beliefs of religious fanatics &#x2013; then we must know, or think we know, what just the right amount of these things is. If we can recognize greed when we see it, we must know how people should eat; if we can be appalled by the sexual excesses reported in the tabloids, we must know what kind of sex people should be having, and how often they should be having it; if we are full of righteous indignation about people we think of as &#x2018;religious fanatics&#x2019;, we must surely have very strong ideas about how much people should believe things, about what people should believe in and what their beliefs should drive them to do. But what is the right amount of belief? How do we know when someone&#x2019;s grief is excessive? Perhaps when it makes us feel something more excessive than we would like to feel?There is an obvious irony here: many of the things that matter most to us &#x2013; like love, or grief, or appetite, or violence, or political and religious belief &#x2013; cannot be measured; and yet one of the things we are most alert to, one of the things we speak about with the most passionate conviction, is when we feel these things have become excessive. It is as if we have our own internal measure of these things that can&#x2019;t be quantified; and this internal measure is one of the most important things about us. How could we live without a sense of what is excessive? Indeed, as I have said, is it not striking how excessive we can be in our reactions to other people&#x2019;s excesses? Nothing makes us more excessive than excess; nothing makes us more disapproving, disgusted, punitive &#x2013; not to mention fascinated, exhilarated and amazed &#x2013; than other people&#x2019;s extravagant appetite for food, or alcohol, or money, or drugs, or violence; nothing makes us more frightened, more furious, more despairing than other people&#x2019;s extreme commitment to political ideals or religious beliefs. It is, one should notice, almost always other people who are being excessive in their belief, not oneself. &#x2018;One is never, in any way whatever, overwhelmed by another person&#x2019;s excesses,&#x2019; the French psycho analyst Jacques Lacan once said, &#x2018;one is only and always overwhelmed because their excesses happen to coincide with your own.&#x2019; From a psychoanalytic point of view other people&#x2019;s excesses disturb us, get us worked up, because they reveal something important to us about ourselves; about our own fears and longings. Indeed, other people&#x2019;s excesses might reveal to us, at its most minimal, that we are, or have become, the excessive animals; the animals for whom excessive behaviour is the rule rather than the exception (there are laws of human nature, but not for us). You only have to read the newspapers to realize that this is a plausible possibility. Our excesses may be in excess of our capacity to understand and to regulate. And if we have become the excessive animals we may have to do more than merely aspire not to be.When Lacan suggests that we are only overwhelmed by other people&#x2019;s excesses because they are the same as our own he is not simply saying, for example, that our horror about drug addiction means that we are secretly tempted or prone to become drug addicts; but that drug addiction may be a picture, say, of how fearful we might be generally of our own dependence, how terrified we are of becoming enslaved to the people we need. And drug addiction can also be a picture of how tempted we are to try to become everything that the person we love needs; to become, in a way, their drug of choice. In other words, Lacan&#x2019;s point is that our reaction to other people&#x2019;s excesses is an important clue to something vital about ourselves; our reflex response to other people&#x2019;s excessive behaviour &#x2013; the thrill of righteous indignation, the moral superiority of our disgust &#x2013; is more complex and more interesting than it at first seems. If other people&#x2019;s excesses reveal the bigot in us, they also reveal how intriguing and subtle the bigot is. There is nothing more telling, nothing more revealing of one&#x2019;s own character and history and taste, than one&#x2019;s reaction to other people&#x2019;s excesses. Tell me which kinds of excess fascinate you, tell me which kinds of excess appall you, and I will tell you who you are. This would be one, excessive, way of putting it. Or one could more sensibly say: notice which excesses you are drawn to (and there is, of course, an excess of excesses to choose from now &#x2013; road rage, fundamentalism, self-improvement, shopping), the ones you can&#x2019;t stop complaining about, the ones that make you speak out, or the ones that just give you some kind of secret, perhaps slightly embarrassing pleasure, and try to work out what about them is so compelling.Excessive behaviour, it seems obvious to say, attracts our attention; what is perhaps less obvious is why it should do so. We are excessively interested in the excessive behaviour that interests us; and to be excessively interested is to be more interested than we would like to be. So even though it would be silly to say that our reaction to other people&#x2019;s excesses is the key to our nature &#x2013; because there is no key to our nature &#x2013; it is true to say, I think, that our reactions to other people&#x2019;s excesses reveal to us what our conflicts are. I don&#x2019;t want to be a drug addict, but I do want to be free to need someone; and I don&#x2019;t want to lose my life when I do need them. I don&#x2019;t want to be a suicide bomber, but I may want to have something in my life that is so important to me that I would risk my life for it; or I may simply want to be aggressive enough to be able to protect the people I love. Or I may even want to have the courage of my despair. The excesses of other people, and of ourselves, can make us think, rather than merely react. Indeed, something as powerful as excess might &#x2013; if we can suspend our fear &#x2013; allow us to have thoughts we have never had before. After all, inspiration, falling in love, conversion experiences, a sense of injustice &#x2013; the most radical transformations that can occur in a life &#x2013; are traditionally overwhelming, excessive experiences. Even though we often want to get over them, to get back to normal as quickly as possible. &#x2018;For the doctrine of conversion,&#x2019; the Victorian classicist Benjamin Jowett wrote, &#x2018;the moralist substitutes the theory of habit.&#x2019; And nothing, of course, is more excessive than a habit.So perhaps when the poet William Blake wrote in his &#x2018;Proverbs of Hell&#x2019; that &#x2018;The road of excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom&#x2019;, he wasn&#x2019;t joking? We don&#x2019;t tend to look to anorexics or gluttons, to the extravagantly rich or the promiscuous, for wisdom; we don&#x2019;t think of drug addicts or mass murderers as necessarily enlightened. So perhaps Blake was being ironic; they are, after all, &#x2018;Proverbs of Hell&#x2019;. Perhaps the road of excess, through the very disillusionments it produces, is a source of wisdom; that it is not the alcoholic but the recovering alcoholic who has something to tell us. Perhaps as part of growing up we need to be excessive &#x2013; to try to break all the rules just to be able to find out what, if anything, the rules are made of, and why they matter. Perhaps only the road of excess can teach us when enough is enough. (And perhaps &#x2018;perhaps&#x2019; &#x2013; like all our cherished rhetoric of self-doubt &#x2013; is one way we temper our excesses in language.) As Blake says, in another of his proverbs, &#x2018;You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.&#x2019; Either certain kinds of excess are not simply good for us, but essential to our well-being; or we need to go through excessive experiences to discover what they can&#x2019;t do for us, to discover just how much of something we really need. But what is a Palace of Wisdom? And why would that be a good place to go to?&nbsp;Excerpted from On Balance by Adam Phillips.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Adam Phillips.<br>Published in 2010 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

In Finland, shamanism is the source of their system of magick. Now you can learn their system in <i>Finnish Magic</i> by Robert Nelson, Ph.D. <br> <br>In this book you will discover the ancient national epic of Finland known as the <i>Kalevala</i>. This book involves the search for magical power and is "the single greatest influence on the formation and definition of modern Finland" according to the author. <br> <br><i>Finnish Magic</i> describes the ancient Finnish beliefs about deities and spirits. You'll learn about the primary Finnish deity, <i>Jumala</i>, and how the Finns also adopted some of the Norse deities. Also described is the notion that everything has a spirit, followed by a discussion of how those spirits are different from each other. <br> <br>Next, <i>Finnish Magic</i> goes into the methods of shamanism and Finnish magic. This is one of the best explanations of shamanic practices ever published. You will learn about the nature of the shamanic trance and the steps you need to follow: <br> <br>- How to go enter a trance <br>- How to begin your shamanic trance journey <br>- How to contact your guides <br>- What to do when you contact your guides <br>- What your guides will do and how to follow them <br>- How to return from your journey <br>- How to leave the trance <br> <br>All of these are guidelines. Dr. Nelson reveals that the key to Finnish magic is contained in three words: "Do what works." You will learn how to add spontaneity to your rituals. You will also learn about using drums, song, and dance to make your magic work. <br> <br>Other topics include shapeshifting, the runes, charms, talismans, amulets, the Finnish festivals of the year and how they are celebrated, how to honor ancestors, and much more. <br> <br>If you are interested in shamanism, in Finland, or just ways to enhance your magical abilities, this book must be one you study.<br></p><p></p><h2>A to Z of Knitting: The Ultimate Guide for the Beginner to Advanced Knitter</h2><p><p>Now in paperback, this must-have resource offers all the knitting know-how you'll ever need!

When she arrived on campus in the fall of 2009, she was the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, a collaborative Internet project that revolutionized the sharing of information, including news. Before joining Wikimedia, Gardner spent a decade as a reporter and producer for CBC Radio, eventually guiding the development of the CBC&#39;s online news services. In the spring of 2014, she left Wikimedia to devote her time to other projects, particularly those related to maintaining an open and free Internet. In a rapidly changing media world, Sue Gardner never stands still.A to Z of Knitting: The Ultimate Guide for the Beginner to Advanced Knitter by Martingale &amp; Company is a thorough but standard learn-to-knit book. It starts at the beginning -- literally, opening with a history of knitting. From there, the book walks you through the things you need to learn before you cast on: needles, yarn fibers and textures, sundry tools and accessories, abbreviations and how to read patterns and charts. It even tells you different ways to hold the yarns and needles.<br>I am not fond of the cast on section. It begins by stating that all cast ons must begin with a slipknot, which is not true. The most commonly used cast on, the long-tail method, uses no knot, and is not taught in this book. However, the rest of the instructions are tops. Other tutorials include: basic knit and purl stitches, increases, decreases, ribbing, buttonholes, bobbles, cables, adding beads and sequins, fair isle, entralac, short rows, lace, looped knitting, knitting in the round, embroidery and decorative stitching, multiple methods of correcting mistakes, grafting and seaming, blocking, fringe and tassel, pom-poms, and caring for your knit garments. The photographs are clear and easy to follow and all in color. You would be surprised at how many knitting books only have sketches or black and white photos. Each technique also comes with a photo of a finished swatch, so you know what it is supposed to look like. --Alyse Wax, Knit Picks, Blogcritics Magazine</p><h2>The New Thoreau Handbook</h2><p>A Thoreau chronology accompanies critical studies of Thoreau&#39;s life, works, sources, ideas, art, and reputation</p><p></p><h2>Christmas Songs Made in America: Favorite Holiday Melodies and the Stories of Their Origins</h2><p>Covers &#34;Away in a Manger,&#34; &#34;Jingle Bells,&#34; &#34;White Christmas,&#34; and &#34;Jingle Bell Rock&#34;</p><p>From the music of "Jingle Bells" and "White Christmas" to "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "Away in the Manager" to "Jolly Old Saint Nicholas" and "All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth," Americans have placed their stamp on the holiday season. But where did these songs that Americans use to celebrate the season come from? How or why were these songs written? And why have they continued to define what Christmas is to so many of us? These are some of the questions Albert and Shirley Menendez tackle in this charming book about the origins of forty-five "Christmas Songs Made in America." <p>For decades, songwriters and lyricists have used popular, folk, rock, sacred, and country songs to clebrate the season's heartfelt cheer. Some were written for Broadway, others for Hollywood. Some entertained children, others set a romantic mood. Some grew out from the chains of slavery, others from the joyous freedom of faith. If there's a story to tell about a Christmas song, you're likely to find it here.</p>Albert J. Menendez and Shirley C. Menendez are a husband-and-wife-research and writing team who have collaborated on numerous projects. Between them they have published more than thirty volumes, including &#34;Christmas in the White House,&#34; &#34;The Sherlock Holmes Quiz Book,&#34; and &#34;The December Wars.&#34; They live in Maryland.</p><h2>Darkness Be My Friend (The Tomorrow Series #4)</h2><p>The battle continues as five ordinary kids must journey back into the heart of an epic conflict.<br><br>Five months into World War III, Ellie and her four remaining friends have barely escaped the Australian town of Wirrawee with their lives and their sanity intact.<br>But as the next step becomes clear, they realize they must once again sacrifice their hard-won comfort and safety. A group of soldiers has recruited the kids to guide the way to the Wirrawee air base.<br>What could possibly motivate Ellie and her friends to return? This risky sabotage mission may be their only hope of rescuing their families, too.</p><p>There are only five of them left now. Ellie and her four friends, Lee, Homer, Kevin, and Fi, have reluctantly returned to New Zealand from Australia to lead more guerrilla attacks on the enemy (who invaded their country in the previous book, <i>Tomorrow, When the War Began</i>). The group has staged raids on their captive hometown Wirrawee from the wilderness sanctuary they call Hell, blowing up and burning enemy headquarters and bridges and supply depots, and killing with their bare hands when they must. By the end of the two sequels, <i>The Dead of Night</i> and <i>A Killing Frost</i>, they are strong and resourceful, but tired and soul-sick with the pervasive violence. Two of them have been killed, and one has killed himself in despair. When they were rescued and airlifted to New Zealand, they thought the nightmare was over. But now they have been sent back to Wirrawee to guide a party of adult raiders on a planned sabotage of a strategic airfield. Something goes wrong; the adults never come back from the raid, and Ellie and her friends are again left on their own to do what they can--and must--to survive. <p> Like John Marsden's other books, this story is immersed in darkness and dread. It's packed with almost unbearable suspense and breathtaking action, as the personalities and relationships of these decent country kids are eroded by the imperative for violence. Marsden fans will elbow each other aside for a copy of this one, and will look forward to the three new installments on the way. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>John Marsden accidentally put himself through the perfect training to become a novelist. <br><br>He read vast numbers of books, acquired a love of language, and became insatiably curious about other people.

Noticing a complete lack of interest in reading among his Year 9 students he tried his hand at writing a short novel that he thought they might enjoy. <br><br>The rest is history.

The color descriptions are based on Ridgeway's Color Standards, in so far as practicable, together with the general color effect in most cases, for ease of interpretation. The height in inches and season of bloom from very early (v. E.) to very late which follow my own ratings, are based on an average of seasons, locations, and soil types.<br><br>The name of the introducer with date of introduction, and awards at national or similar exhibitions are given following the name of the variety. The rating of the Symposium Committee of the American Iris Society is the figures which immediately follows the name of the variety. Since many varieties have not been rated, I am giving in addition my personal comparative estimation of the different varieties, both for exhibition (e.) and landscape or garden (g.) uses. These ratings are based upon experience of growing the different varieties side by side and a study of the different factors, including growth, effectiveness, poise, height, color, form, size, substance, and distinctive qualities, all of which go to make up a perfect iris for both exhibition and garden purposes. The ratings on the more recent introductions are subject to revision as further experience may bring out their fa'ults, if any, or further demonstrate their superior qualities. I have hesitated to publish these ratings because personal likes and dislikes do enter into such considerations. I have endeavored, however, to deal frankly and accurately with the diflerent varieties and having been urged to publish them hope the suggestions may be helpful, especially to those who may be interested in the new and untried introductions. The reader may ask why an old iris such as Iris King has been placed with the best and most outstanding varieties, while such fine varieties as Hyperion with a higher rating are excluded. The reason is that while Hyperion is a finer individual iris than Iris King in size, form, and height, there are some even better varieties of very similar coloring, while Iris King is still one of the best in its particular color and is, therefore, given the preference in this list. Undoubtedly, some of the newer varieties may demonstrate their superior qualities to such an extent that they may displace some that now seem to be among the best. I welcome suggestions and criticism on these points based upon the experience of others in different locations.<br><br>About the Publisher<br><br>Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

A trove of portraits taken in the tiny French town of Vignacourt just behind the front lines was found a century later in an ancient metal chest in a French farmhouse.

A man of great natural dignity, imbued with respect for tradition and love of the land, he is also despotic and virtually illiterate. Into the family comes his son&#39;s new wife, a spirited, intelligent girl from the town. Her eyes see a different world--one tainted by grossness, cruelty, and squalor--and she suffers from the hostility of jealous sisters-in-law and the shortcomings of a husband whom she loves but cannot respect. Her relationship with Stepan Mikhailovich is the heart of a story in which Aksakov celebrates the old feudal way of life without concealing its darker, repressive side.</p><p>Aksakov was considered one of 19th century Russia&#39;s finest prose stylists.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Jacques Brel -- The Biography</h2><p>The only English language biography, this is a candid exploration of the French cult figure.</p><p></p><h2>Radiant Mind: Awakening Unconditioned Awareness</h2><p><p>Whether it is called enlightenment, pure presence, or "unconditioned awareness," there exists an awakened state of true liberation that is at the heart of every contemplative tradition. </p><p>Yet according to Peter Fenner, this experience of boundless consciousness does not have to exist separately from your day-to-day "conditioned" existence.

Written for young adults, &#34;Dear Friend&#34; is illustrated with numerous contemporary drawings and engravings and written in a clear, clean style. Nonetheless, despite its intended audience, it doesn&#39;t sugarcoat the horrors of slavery; it movingly and eloquently depicts the strength and courage of those who ran the Underground Railroad and of the slaves who made the arduous journey to freedom.In a work given the expanded subtitle ``Collaborators on the Underground Railroad,'' Bentley (Harriet Tubman, 1990, etc.) offers details of the eastern line of that route through the correspondence between a white man and Quaker, Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, and a free black man, William Still, of Philadelphia. Together they helped thousands of runaways to freedom, and fought for the abolition of slavery. Also included is information about some of the slaves as well as the political and social context for Garrett and Still's activities. They are crucial figures in the history of the Underground Railroad, but readers may not gain an appreciation for these men from this disjointed, confusing narrative. There are regular shifts in time, space, and focus, e.g., a negotiation regarding runaway slaves is interrupted for a flashback on Garrett's origins, his revelation as to the evils of slavery, the growth of his business, his first wife and their children, and his 38 years with his second wife. The most exciting parts of the stories are often given only fleeting treatment. A book that may fill out reports and other assignments on the Underground Railroad, but won't draw readers in the way the dramatic subject matter suggests.

Turner (1775-1851) is renowned for his sublime and dramatic landscapes and seascapes. This volume, written by Turner expert James Hamilton and published in conjunction with a travelling exhibition organized by the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, focuses primarily on the artist&#39;s spectacular seascapes dating from the 1840s, the last decade of his illustrious career. The author provides insights into these powerful works, relating them to the artist&#39;s interest in poetry and drama as well as his curiosity about science, optics and photography. Turner&#39;s extensive travels and the relationship between Turner&#39;s paintings and 17th-century Dutch precedents are discussed in depth.

Symons's eight-year quest to uncover the life story of Frederick Rolfe - a.k.a. the Baron Corvo, a lonely, arrogant genius - and construct something remarkable of it.<br>The author of the brilliant novel Hadrian the Seventh, Corvo was by turns a gifted painter, teacher, student of the priesthood, historian, and inventor of a process of "deep sea photography." He also had a veritable genius for making enemies and lived out his last years as a penniless exile. With letters (many of them masterpieces of invective), excerpts from his novels, and accounts of unusual interviews with Corvo's friends, fans, and enemies, Symons chronicles a passionate investigation into Corvo's secret life - and produces an uproariously comic, ultimately tragic, and stunningly rendered work of art.</p><p>A.J.A.&nbsp;Symons (1900-1941) pursued a wide variety of projects in his short life, writing and editing works on the verse of the 1890s, the history of the Nonesuch Press, and critical studies of various figures of note. He is remembered for his groundbreaking biography of the bizarre genius Baron Corvo and for his own eccentric hobbies, as chronicled in a biography written by his brother, the mystery novelist Julian Symons.<br><br>A S Byatt&nbsp;is renowned internationally for her novels and short stories.

'The Quest for Corvo' is biography in the form of a detective story, and as such it is riveting....The surest formula for a masterpiece biography&#x2014;of which there are not that many&#x2014;is an extraordinary human being writing about a great one. In 'The Quest for Corvo' we have an utterly charming man writing on a madly eccentric one....A slender book, an odd book, a completely original book, [it] also represents a new method of writing biography that has never been copied." &nbsp;&#x2014;Joseph Epstein, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><h2>Ariel Custer (Grace Livingston Hill #8)</h2><p>When Ariel Custer and Judson Granniss become the primary suspects in a murder case, they must find the truth before their happiness is shattered. <br><br><b>Grace Livingston Hill</b> is the beloved author of more than 100 books.

The result is fun reading." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p> "[A] riveting account of her own rise to the top." --<i>Globe</i></p><p> "Why are we so unforgiving when it comes to 'real-size' actresses? If anyone is qualified to explain that paradox it's Burke." --<i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i></p>TV sitcom star (Filthy Rich, Designing Women) Burke describes her journey from beauty pageant winner (18 in all) to TV star and, most recently, tabloid fodder for her weight problems in this "slim" but engaging memoir/style book. While pageants gave Burke a start, it was TV that made her a household name, most particularly as the irrepressibly self-absorbed Suzanne Sugarbaker on Designing Women. It was also in TV that she discovered that anything larger than the size six she struggled to maintain was not acceptable; in Hollywood, beauty is apparently only for the slim. Burke points out that a double standard exists in the entertainment industry: "I went from being Barbie on a pedestal to a sexless, unattractive nonentity... Whereas my husband [actor Gerald McRaney], who is balding, who is getting a little bit of a potbelly, and who is now fifty, nonetheless is expected to romance twenty-year-olds in his onscreen roles." Now, after years of struggling to maintain a size that pleased TV executives and cameras, Burke has come to terms with her weight. She offers solid advice for maximizing one's appearance and developing the confidence to live up to one's own image, not someone else's. She also includes resources for products and clothing created for the "real-size" woman. Burke's fans and anyone who has struggled with weight and attendant self-esteem issues will likely welcome the story of a once slender, still beautiful woman who, rather than conform to an impossible (and possibly unhealthy) standard of body size, has chosen to celebrate what she is rather than to lament what she is not. 48 pages of color photos.

Coauthor with Michael Caduto of the bestselling Keepers of the Earth series, Bruchac&#39;s poems, articles and stories have appeared in hundreds of publications, from Akwesasne Notes and American Poetry Review to National Geographic and Parabola. He has authored many books for adults and children including Code Talker: A Novel About the Navajo Marines of World War Two, Skeleton Man, and The Heart of a Chief. For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.This adaptation of a popular Native American story pits Animals against Birds in a contest to settle an all-too-human question: Who's better? Here, it's the teeth versus the wings in stickball, a lacrosse-style game in which the players hold a stick in each hand. When the contestants take their sides, the anomalous Bat, who sports both teeth and wings, is rejected by both teams. Finally, Bear shows sympathy, saying, "You are not very big, but sometimes even the small ones can help." Bat is benched, however, until the Animals catch on to the Birds' obvious advantage: with ball in beak, the Birds fly high above the playing field. But as evening darkness descends, Bat flies into gear to win the game with his elusive, darting aerobatics. As the victor, Bat decrees that the Birds must leave for half the year. And, according to Muskogee legend, this resolution explains why bats are categorized as animals and why birds fly south for the winter. With clear, minimal language, Bruchac (see The Girl Who Married the Moon, reviewed below) wisely lets the myth carry itself. While the three-dimensional effect of Roth's (Fire Came to the Earth People) textured paper collages is striking and initially intriguing, the illustrations do not much embellish the sparely told story. But in its call for an athletic game to settle a dispute-and thereby avoid fighting-the book handily inverts the Greco-Roman tradition of sport as training for war.

And he&#39;s doing it under the scrutiny of an internal inquiry led by a man he has just accused of taking backhanders from Glasgow&#39;s Mr Big. As if this wasn&#39;t enough, there are TV cameras at his back investigating a miscarriage of justice, making Rebus a criminal in the eyes of a million or more viewers. Just one mistake is likely to mean an unpleasant and not particularly speedy death or, worse still, losing his job.</p><p>"I'm a peeper, he thought, a voyeur. All cops are. But he knew he was more than that: he liked to get involved in the lives around him. He had a need to know which went beyond voyeurism. It was a drug. And the thing was, when he had all this knowledge, he then had to use booze to blank it out..." In his ninth outing, Edinburgh's glowering and tenacious Inspector John Rebus finds a unique way of cutting back on alcohol. Convinced that Rebus might lie or try to destroy evidence in the reopened case of a man convicted of a murder he probably didn't commit, the investigating officer assigns him a babysitter. Luckily, the minder is one of Rebus's old mentors, Jack Morton, a former drinking buddy now waging a successful battle against the bottle. Rebus and Morton burn off energy and anger repainting Rebus's apartment, while trying to clear Rebus's name and exploring the connection between a recent string of murders and a real-life Scottish serial killer of the 1970s known as Bible John. The cases take Rebus to Aberdeen and an oil platform in the North Atlantic, but as usual the main action happens within the mind and soul of Rankin's meticulously crafted creation.

Without this, good proposals that arise lack political will and go unimplemented.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pally describes our basic setup as &#x201c;separability-amid-situatedness&#x201d; or &#x201c;distinction-amid-relation.&#x201d; Though we are all unique individuals, we become our singular selves through our relations and responsibilities to the people and environments around us. Pally argues that our culture&#x2019;s overemphasis on &#x201c;separability&#x201d; &#x2014; individualism run amok &#x2014; results in greed, adversarial and deceitful political discourse and chicanery, resource grabbing, broken relationships, and anomie.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining that separability and situatedness can and must be considered together in public policy, Pally draws on intellectual history, philosophy, and &#x2014; especially &#x2014; historic Christian and Jewish theologies of relationality to construct a new framework for addressing present economic and political ills.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Marcia Pally teaches multilingual multicultural studies at New York University and at Fordham University and is a guest professor in the theology department at Humboldt University in Berlin. She is also the author of <i>The New Evangelicals: Expanding</i><i>the Vision for the Common Good</i>.<br><b><i>Journal of Markets and Morality</i></b><br> "This erudite and original book offers a substantial contribution in its articulation of the political and economic implications of a theology of covenant and relationality."<br><br><b><i>Religious Studies Review</i></b><br> "Pally masterfully brings political and economic ethics together with a sound theological narrative."<br><br><b>William Storrar</b><br> &#x2014; Center of Theological Inquiry<br> "<i>Has the West lost its pizzazz and gravitas</i>? asks Marcia Pally at the start of&nbsp;<i>Commonwealth and Covenant</i>. Not if we read this magisterial study of relationality in Western theology and culture, brimming as it is with her signature brio and erudition as a leading thinker on religion and society. With an original and compelling thesis as her lantern, Pally lights up not only the history of ideas with dazzling insight but also our present parlous state with hopeful remedy."<br><br><b>Harvey Cox</b><br> &#x2014; Harvard University<br> "In her previous writing Marcia Pally has demonstrated keen insight into the American religious situation. In this well-crafted and highly readable book she takes a central principle in the American spiritual heritage &#x2014; the covenant &#x2014; and relates it with impressive skill to the psychological and political dimensions of our lives.

This most welcome book leverages an ancient and helpfully foreign concept &#x2014; the biblical idea of covenant &#x2014; to move beyond this paralyzing binary.

Marcia Pally's&nbsp;<i>Commonwealth and Covenant</i>&nbsp;opens up a broad and generous middle way, one that is interdisciplinarily informed, historically rooted, philosophically robust, and theologically foundational.

This 1996 novel predates Pettersen's acclaimed <i>Out Stealing Horses</i> (first published in 2003), and has all of Pettersen's haunted charms. As an unnamed young girl and her big brother, Jesper (who calls her Sistermine), grow up in rural WWII-era Denmark, the two cope with distant parents, an eccentric extended family and the cold wind. Jesper longs to go south to Morocco; Sistermine yearns for the plains of Siberia, foreshadowing lives that will diverge. Their grandfather's suicide, the arrival of puberty and most tragically, the German invasion change their idyllic childhood relationship; as each sibling fights back against the occupation in his or her own way, their inevitable separation looms. The second half of the novel, in which Sistermine struggles to make sense of her life in various Scandinavian cities and towns, awaiting a hoped-for reunion with Jesper, is less breathtaking and mesmerizing than the first, but the contrast makes her numb loneliness and inability to connect all the more poignant. The book builds up slowly, casting a spell of beauty and devastation that matches the bleak but dazzling climate that enshrouds Sistermine's young life. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A native West Virginian, she lives with her husband Keith in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.1<br>SATURDAY NIGHT<br>Tamara dried the last crystal wineglass, held it up to the fading summer light shining through the kitchen window, and nodded. Spotless. She hated spots on glasses, particularly crystal. Tomorrow night, when Warren came home from his conference in Cleveland, they&#x2019;d share a bottle of Chateau Latour Blanche on their sixth anniversary. Tamara was not a wine connoisseur, but he&#x2019;d assured her the Latour Blanche was expensive and should be properly appreciated. When she&#x2019;d fussed about spending a lot of money on a bottle of wine, he said it was a gift from a patient. Tamara knew better than to ask which one. Warren was a psychologist and never discussed his patients.<br>Tamara looked around the pristine kitchen. The whole house was spotless. With no children and no job, she had more than enough time to keep the house perfect.<br>Tonight, however, she had nothing left to clean. She&#x2019;d even reorganized the kitchen cabinets and put down fresh shelf paper. She could work on her latest quilt, the lovely one with the hummingbird design she&#x2019;d created, but she wasn&#x2019;t in the mood. She could drop by the headquarters of the suicide hotline Warren had forced her to organize, but tonight she didn&#x2019;t want to hear any sad stories. She didn&#x2019;t enjoy Saturday night television and she felt too restless to read. Usually she took an evening walk, but a storm was predicted.<br>Tamara looked out the window and sighed. Daylight Saving Time extended light until nine o&#x2019;clock. So far it was a lovely evening, a bit cloudier than usual, but still nice. Surely the storm wouldn&#x2019;t hit for over an hour. That left plenty of time for a walk.<br>She grabbed an old white sweater off the coat tree beside the back door. It was mid-June, but Port Ariel, Ohio, sat on the edge of Lake Erie, which sent cool breezes off its water all year. The comfortable temperature was what drew so many tourists to the beach area every summer. Warren hated tourists, but Tamara spent most of her time at home and rarely had contact with them. Besides, they were good for local business and therefore good for her twin sister Lily, who owned a successful antique store downtown. Tamara was making the hummingbird quilt for Lily&#x2019;s shop. &#x201c;People like old furniture but not old bedding. Only bedding that looks old,&#x201d; Lily always said. &#x201c;I could sell three times the number of these gorgeous quilts you make!&#x201d; Tamara was pleased by their popularity, but she never increased her production. Haste made for sloppy work.<br>As she automatically locked the back door and descended the porch steps, Tamara glanced at her watch. Eight-thirty. Warren always called promptly at ten when he was out of town. She frowned. She mustn&#x2019;t be late for the call. Things were rocky between them. Warren had been irritable, quiet, and aloof for months. Tamara felt he was disappointed that she hadn&#x2019;t been able to give him a child, although he never mentioned it. Lily contended that Warren didn&#x2019;t want a child&#x2014;not everyone did. Tamara told her sister she was being ridiculous.<br>To be twins, they were so different, hardly like sisters at all except for their looks and their love for each other. Lily wasn&#x2019;t even religious in spite of their strict Catholic upbringing. Ignoring Lily&#x2019;s good-natured skepticism, Tamara had begun attending mass every day, praying for the child that would draw Warren back to her. Now she knew her prayers had worked. Her periods were always irregular, but this time she was over a month late. She&#x2019;d taken a home pregnancy test this morning and she had wonderful news for Warren, which she&#x2019;d save until tomorrow evening when he returned.<br>Humming beneath her breath, Tamara crossed the lawn and walked down Hyacinth Lane, a wide dirt road running north through a wooded area. She delighted in the towering oaks, locust trees, and scattered dogwoods and crab apples. When the dogwoods and crab apples were in bloom, this place seemed like a fairy world.<br>She took a rubber band out of her sweater pocket and pulled back her long blond hair in a ponytail. Delicate silver filigree earrings set with amethyst stones swayed in the breeze, tickling her neck. She tilted back her head, closed her eyes, and drew a deep breath. Clean, clear air tinged with the scent of approaching rain and the water of Lake Erie filled her delicate nostrils. When she was young, she and Lily had spent countless hours on the lake in their parents&#x2019; cabin cruiser and their sleek twenty-foot inboard motorboat. The girls were excellent water-skiers. Warren went out with the family sometimes on the cabin cruiser, but he always stayed on board. He didn&#x2019;t even fish.<br>Something rustled in the underbrush. Naturally timid, Tamara grew motionless, her gaze scanning the sides of the road. She knew the sound probably came from a small animal. Most of them were perfectly harmless except for poisonous snakes, although there weren&#x2019;t many of those around. Besides, a snake wouldn&#x2019;t make so much noise and it certainly wouldn&#x2019;t attack unless threatened.<br>Her mind knew this. Her body didn&#x2019;t. She felt cold, imagining a sleek head rising up to bury venom-filled fangs in the skin of her ankle.<br>The rustling grew louder. Tamara stiffened. She was ready to turn and dash for home when a large dog burst from the greenery on her left. It bounded to her, panting.<br>&#x201c;Well, hello there!&#x201d; Tamara exclaimed, laughing in relief. This was the fourth evening in a row she&#x2019;d seen the dog on her walk. It had wiry black-and-tan hair, mostly black, and seemed to wear a perpetual smile. She called it &#x201c;Happy Face.&#x201d; Showing no fear of humans, the dog approached her on slender tan legs with white paws, its curled tail wagging. Tamara bent to pet it. She had no idea what breed it was, but she thought it would be beautiful if it were bathed. Instead its hair was matted and slightly oily. It wore no collar, and a fresh scratch ran down the right side of its tan face.<br>Poor thing, Tamara thought. She&#x2019;d love to have the dog, but Warren had firmly pronounced they could not take it in. He didn&#x2019;t like animals. The dog was so endearing, but it was getting thinner. She decided to buy dog food tomorrow. At least she could keep the dog well fed even if she couldn&#x2019;t give it a home.<br>Happy Face walked beside her for a while, glancing up as if for approval. Wild violets grew along the edges of Hyacinth Lane. Tamara stooped and picked a few while the dog waited patiently. A slate-gray catbird emitted its lonely mewing call to the evening. A few ambitious fireflies were already hard at work, blinking gaudily against the darkening sky.<br>Tamara looked at her watch again. 8:45. She should return home. She could be bathed and ready for bed by the time Warren called. She smiled. When she was ready for bed, Lily would be ready for a night at trendy Panache. Their old friend Natalie St. John was back in town and Lily wanted to show her a good time. She&#x2019;d invited Tamara along, but Tamara declined, telling her she would be waiting for Warren&#x2019;s call. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re hopeless,&#x201d; Lily had teased. &#x201c;I might get married some day but I&#x2019;ll never be as settled as you. Hovering around the phone at ten for a husband?&#x201d; Apparently Lily thought hovering only justified in cases of handsome, unpredictable boyfriends.<br>The dog looked up at her expectantly. She&#x2019;d forgotten their game. &#x201c;Okay, Happy Face.&#x201d; Tamara bent and picked up a stick. The dog shifted from paw to paw in anticipation. Tamara threw the stick far into the trees. The dog shot after it. Usually it returned in less than a minute with the stick, which it dropped at her feet. This time Tamara heard it barking. The barking grew fainter. Obviously it had spotted a rabbit and was giving chase. At least she hoped it was a rabbit. She didn&#x2019;t want to be greeted by a dog reeking of skunk.<br>She stood on the road for a few minutes. Up ahead reared the remains of Saunders House built back in the early nineteenth century when Port Ariel was called Winthrop. When the senior Saunderses died, their beautiful daughter Ariel became the lover of Captain Zebediah Winthrop, whose father had founded the town. Ariel was labeled a &#x201c;scarlet woman&#x201d; after she gave birth to Zebediah&#x2019;s son Thaddeus out of wedlock. In his youth Zebediah had been forced to marry a homely crab of a woman inaptly named Mercy. While Zebediah sailed Lake Erie, Mercy and her pious friends delighted in wreaking petty vengeances on Ariel and the baby, terrorizing the young mother. Then, when Thaddeus was barely one year old, Captain Winthrop&#x2019;s ship, the Mercy, caught fire and foundered on the shore near Ariel&#x2019;s house. Ariel had spotted the wreck from her widow&#x2019;s walk and rushed to the rescue, single-handedly saving two injured sailors and her beloved Zeb from drowning.<br>Mercy died shortly afterward, mostly from bitterness and jealousy and pure meanness, people claimed. She was barely in the ground when Zebediah married Ariel. Most citizens had forgiven her in light of her bravery and did not object when Zebediah changed the name of the town in her honor. Together they had two more children. Zeb died long before Ariel and she had a large monument built to him in the town square. Although she lived to be eighty, she never remarried.<br>As children Tamara and Lily were entranced by the story of Ariel who had lived alone on the windy shore of Lake Erie, tormented yet strong and loving. They thought she was beautiful, wonderful, courageous, and all that a woman should be. Unbeknownst to their parents, they used to dress up and play for hours in the Saunders house, taking turns at pretending to be Ariel. Sometimes Natalie St. John played with them. Tamara had seen pictures of Ariel and thought that with her long black hair and dark eyes, Natalie made the best Ariel, but she never told Lily. Natalie was the only one of their friends with whom they shared the secret of the game. Natalie could always be trusted with a secret.<br>For just a moment Tamara had an impulse to forge ahead and take a look at the decrepit house. Then she glanced up. Dark clouds billowed. The summer storm was blowing in faster than she&#x2019;d expected. She had no time for exploring now. She&#x2019;d left several of her windows up and her new car in the driveway beneath a tree instead of in the garage.<br>Tamara turned and took several hurried steps down Hyacinth Lane. Tree limbs swayed and creaked. A silvery shaft of lightning ripped the gray sky. Tamara&#x2019;s ponytail blew wildly in the wind and a piece of dirt flew into her right eye. She stopped, rubbing at it gently. Damn. It had lodged under a contact lens.<br>A tear ran down her cheek. Lord, it hurt. She shut her eye and took a few more hurried steps. A scrabbling sound pulled her up short. She jerked her head to the right. What on earth was that? It sounded as if it were rushing at her.<br>&#x201c;Happy Face?&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;Happy, is that you?&#x201d;<br>The rushing sound stopped. Now there was silence, but a sinister silence. Something was watching her. She could feel the gaze running up and down her body. Her hands turned icy. She took a deep breath. Don&#x2019;t be silly, Tamara, she told herself sternly. What would be watching you? A chipmunk? A squirrel? Still, a dark wing of fear fluttered inside her. &#x201c;Happy Face?&#x201d; she called again, hopefully, uncertainly.<br>But it wasn&#x2019;t the dog. Suddenly footsteps pounded through the underbrush, snapping vines, then smacking against the bare dirt. Tamara whirled blindly, not sure in which direction to run. It didn&#x2019;t matter. In a flash an arm shot out from a slick, dark mass. Some kind of plastic coat. Tamara yelped in fear as the arm clenched around her neck and yanked backward. She dropped the violets she&#x2019;d picked earlier. Her heels dragged the ground. She clawed uselessly at the sinewy arm locked directly under her chin. Her neck felt as if it were going to snap. Her eyes bulged in fear and shock as she gasped for air. &#x201c;Wha&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>A long steel razor with a bone handle flicked open. In one cold, frozen moment Tamara saw the blade glint in a flash of lightning before it slashed viciously across her throat and around her neck, cutting the vocal cords, severing the carotid artery. Blood spurted straight out, then cascaded down, drenching the sleeve of her white sweater.<br>&#x201c;Their throat is an open tomb,&#x201d; a voice whispered caressingly in her ear as Tamara&#x2019;s slender body jerked grotesquely in its death throes.<br>The arm released Tamara. She fell in a heap, still twitching, her eyes wide, her blood soaking the dirt. The figure kneeled beside her and tucked a note into the fold of her sweater. Then it stood, bowed in a grotesque imitation of servitude, and wafted silently back into the dark, swaying forest.<br>Rain had begun to fall when the dog returned five minutes later. It loped toward Tamara, then abruptly stopped, dropping the stick. It whimpered unhappily. Finally it warily approached the body of the woman who earlier had greeted it so joyously. When it smelled blood, the hair on its back stood up and it crouched, half-crawling to Tamara. It stared at her with warm amber eyes, the smiling look gone from its face. Gently, almost reverently, it lay down and stretched its sleek neck across the gaping slash in hers, protecting her from further harm. As rain poured, the dog howled mournfully into the lonely night.<br></p><h2>Storage: Get Organized</h2><p>Terence Conran, master of interior design, casts his gaze on what is arguably the most intractable home design issue: how to keep your stuff from overwhelming your space.

Two million troops of the British, French, American, and Belgian Armies launched four attacks in rapid succession across a 250km front between the Argonne and Flanders. This huge assault drove the German Army from its last fully prepared defensive position west of the German border and ensured that the War ended in 1918. </p><p> The impact of this defeat had a shattering effect on the Germans. Their army admitted for the first time that an armistice was required to save it from annihilation, peace feelers were sent out to the Americans and the Kaiser began the process of democratizing Germany. Although these decisive results were to a large extent consequences of the battle of the Hindenburg Line, the subsequent controversies over the conduct of the war meant that it went unheralded and has remained Haig's forgotten triumph.</p></p><p>Alistair McCluskey is a serving officer in the British Army.

Provides an intriguing overview of art and our perception of it. Discusses subjects as diverse as photography&#39;s tricks with perspective, the problems of expressing emotion through art and how pictorial representation affects the way in which we see the world</p><p>Ernst Gombrich was one of the greatest and least conventional art historians of his age, achieving fame and distinction in three separate spheres: as a scholar, as a popularizer of art, and as a pioneer of the application of the psychology of perception to the study of art. His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published 50 years ago and now in its sixteenth edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include The Sense of Order (1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.&#34;A generous clarity of style and a quite breathtaking amplitude of reference. Gombrich&#39;s unique combination of wisdom and curiosity is exhilarating.&#34;-The Sunday Times</p><h2>Adventure Time Original Graphic Novel Vol. 6: Masked Mayhem (6)</h2><p>Adventure time is back with another wild Adventure in the land of Ooo!<br><br>Jake and BMO are preparing for Masquerade Day, excited to see what everyone else dresses up as around the kingdom of Ooo.

He was called the finest English metrical poet of his generation by some of his contemporaries, and his work is anthologized in the Oxford Book of Mystical Verse. He was also a profound and experienced magician, mystic, and philosopher, trained in western esotericism, Hermeticism, the Qabalah and more traditional western philosophy, but with a deep and abiding interest in the ancient philosophies of the Orient. Crowley traveled widely in the East, and he actually walked across Southern China in 1906. His first-hand experience of the Orient made him one of the first students in the West to grasp oriental philosophy on its own terms, without a Eurocentric or Judeo-Christian cultural bias. The Chinese scholar Hellmut WIlhelp acknowledged the primacy of Crowleys work in Taoist studies. Crowley had no Chinese, and his translation is that of a poet interpreting the dry and scholastic translation of James Legge, as Ezra Pound would later do with the Confucian Analects. He contributes and autobiographical and critical introduction that discusses his religious philosophy and his lifelong attraction to Taoism, and his extensive notes and commentary to his translation help to amplify the meaning of the Chinese classic. This edition includes Crowleys verse translation of the Ching-ching Ching (Liber XXI, The Classic of Purity) as an appendix. This edition includes an editorial forward by Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of O.T.O., as well as bibliography and index.</p><p>Text: English, Chinese (translation)</p><h2>The Crocodile Under the Bed: The classic illustrated children&#x2019;s book from the author of The Tiger Who Came To Tea</h2><p><p>A magical new classic in the making from the creator of the beloved favourite, The Tiger Who Came to Tea.</p><p>Once there was a little boy called Matty, and he was very sad...</p><p>From the creator of the iconic picture books The Tiger Who Came to Tea and Mog the Forgetful Cat, comes a brand new story about joy, parties... and crocodiles!</p><p>Matty is sick, and very sad because he&#x2019;s too sick to go to the Queen&#x2019;s birthday party!

Now Tomsen draws on a rich trove of never-before-published material to shed new light on the American involvement in the long and continuing Afghan war.<p> This book offers a deeply informed perspective on how Afghanistan's history as a shatter zone&#x201d; for foreign invaders and its tribal society have shaped the modern Afghan narrative. It brings to life the appallingly misinformed secret operations by foreign intelligence agencies, including the Soviet NKVD and KGB, the Pakistani ISI, and the CIA.</p><p> American policy makers, Tomsen argues, still do not understand Afghanistan; nor do they appreciate how the CIA's covert operations and the Pentagon's military strategy have strengthened extremism in the country. At this critical time, he shows how the U.S. and the coalition it leads can assist the region back to peace and stability.</p></p><p><b>Peter Tomsen</b> was President George H.W. Bush's Special Envoy on Afghanistan with the rank of Ambassador from 1989 to 1992. Tomsen entered the Foreign Service in 1967 and served in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union. He was United States Deputy Chief of Mission in China from 1986 to 1989, deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs from 1992 to 1995, and the American Ambassador to Armenia from 1995 to 1998. He lives in Virginia with his wife.<b><br></b>&#x201c;Magisterial... A career U.S. diplomat, Tomsen served as Washington's special envoy to the Afghan resistance in 1989-92, an experience that gave him almost unrivaled personal insight into Afghanistan's slide from anti-Soviet jihad into civil war. His account of the country's political dynamics before, during, and after this period is exhaustively researched, levelheaded, and persuasive....<i>The Wars of Afghanistan</i>&nbsp;should have a place among the indispensable books on the topic.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, July 3, 2011</b><br>&#x201c;Peter Tomsen, a former U.S. envoy to "the Afghan resistance" from 1989 to 1992, reminds us in his sweeping history that the CIA has had a miserable record of understanding the politics of the region. "The Wars of Afghanistan" is rich with details about his interactions with key players during this critical period. Following the Soviet withdrawal, the United States continued to oppose compromise with the last Afghan communist ruler, Mohammad Najibullah, and to arm the mujahedeen, including figures now fighting the Americans. Drawing on these lessons, Tomsen persuasively calls on Washington to wrest policymaking back from the Pentagon and spy agencies, and advocates U.N. mediation of an Afghan peace process.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><b>September 30, 2011</b>&#x201c;[A]dmirably sound.&#x201d;<br><br><p><b>Steve Coll, author of The Bin Ladens and Ghost Wars<br></b>"Peter Tomsen has a depth of understanding and knowledge about the history of Afghanistan that makes him a unique asset in our effort to grapple with the multiple conflicts and intricate politics in what has turned out to be America&#x2019;s longest war.&#x201d;<b><br></b></p><br><br><b><i><b>Winston Lord, former Assistant Secretary of State&nbsp;</b><br></i></b>&#x201c;Accolades like 'magisterial,' 'definitive,' and 'vital' should be reserved for rare books like Peter Tomsen's 'The Wars of Afghanistan.'

It is one of the very few Christian texts that have survived from the first century. The early Christians took utmost care to preserve the letter, copying it out by hand and even risking their lives in order to hide it from persecutors. Some local churches kept it for proclamation as part of the New Testament. </p> <p>The Church Fathers indicated that Clement was a direct disciple of the Saints Peter and Paul. Modern scholars, however, called this into question, arguing that he lived and wrote many decades after the martyrdom of the Apostles. </p> <p>Msgr. Thomas Herron s painstaking research led him to conclude that the Epistle to the Corinthians was composed very early indeed before 70 A.D. He was not the first scholar to argue for an early date, but he was the first to undertake a thorough study of the matter. His methods are rigorous. His writing is clear and honest. His tone is modest. </p> <p>Nevertheless, his conclusions are stunning. He argues persuasively for the earlier dates and then proceeds to sketch out the significance of the early dating for history, theology, and apologetics. </p><p>Clement s Epistle stands as an early example of the exercise of hierarchical and Roman authority in the Church.

For over sixty years disinformation and lies surrounded the story of Klaus Fuchs as the Governments of Britain, the United States and Russia all tried to cover up the truth about his treachery. Piecing together the story from archives in Britain, the United States, Russia and Germany, <i>The Spy Who Changed the World</i> unravels the truth about Fuchs and reveals for the first time his long career of espionage. It proves that he played a pivotal role in Britain's bomb program in the race to keep up with the United States in the atomic age, and that he revealed vital secrets about the atom bomb, as well as the immensely destructive hydrogen bomb to the Soviet Government.

Huggins Lectures)</h2><p><p><i>Emancipating Lincoln</i> seeks a new approach to the Emancipation Proclamation, a foundational text of American liberty that in recent years has been subject to woeful misinterpretation. These seventeen hundred words are Lincoln's most important piece of writing, responsible both for his being hailed as the Great Emancipator and for his being pilloried by those who consider his once-radical effort at emancipation insufficient and half-hearted.</p><p>Harold Holzer, an award-winning Lincoln scholar, invites us to examine the impact of Lincoln&#x2019;s momentous announcement at the moment of its creation, and then as its meaning has changed over time. Using neglected original sources, Holzer uncovers Lincoln&#x2019;s very modern manipulation of the media&#x2015;from his promulgation of disinformation to the ways he variously withheld, leaked, and promoted the Proclamation&#x2015;in order to make his society-altering announcement palatable to America. Examining his agonizing revisions, we learn why a peerless prose writer executed what he regarded as his &#x201c;greatest act&#x201d; in leaden language. Turning from word to image, we see the complex responses in American sculpture, painting, and illustration across the past century and a half, as artists sought to criticize, lionize, and profit from Lincoln&#x2019;s endeavor.</p><p>Holzer shows the faults in applying our own standards to Lincoln&#x2019;s efforts, but also demonstrates how Lincoln&#x2019;s obfuscations made it nearly impossible to discern his true motives. As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Proclamation, this concise volume is a vivid depiction of the painfully slow march of all Americans&#x2015;white and black, leaders and constituents&#x2015;toward freedom.</p></p><p>Harold Holzer is Director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College.&#x201c;With a refreshing blend of analytical rigor and common sense, Harold Holzer places the Emancipation Proclamation in the context of its own time and circumstances, showing how Lincoln prepared public opinion for this controversial act, grounded it in his legal powers as commander in chief, and promoted its growing acceptance with eloquent paeans to freedom as a goal of the Civil War. This is a welcome new study of the Proclamation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James M. McPherson, author of <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i> and <i>Abraham Lincoln</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation approaches, Harold Holzer has given us a splendid book that provides essential historical framing for the document, its reception, and the trajectory of Abraham Lincoln's reputation as the Great Emancipator.

A welcome, balanced, and necessary addition to Lincoln scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edna Greene Medford, Howard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Holzer's tripartite narrative deals first with the historical context of the Proclamation, laying out Lincoln's exquisitely difficult political, legal, moral and martial calculations as he gradually widened his circle of confidants, labored to manipulate public opinion and slyly prepared the nation for his momentous decision. He spent months refining the announcement released after Antietam and steadfastly signed the promised executive order. The author then moves to a discussion of the Proclamation's rhetorical deficiencies (Richard Hofstadter said it contained "all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading"), explains why our most eloquent president wrote so uncharacteristically and points us to contemporaneous speeches and letters for the "poetic accompaniment" to what was, after all, preeminently a legal document. Finally, Holzer turns to the iconography surrounding Lincoln and emancipation, tracing images from the early kneeling-slave, peculiarly disconcerting to modern audiences, on through to treatments by contemporary artists such as Rauschenberg, Basquiat and Kara Walker. This visual evidence effectively underscores his larger point about our troublesome, still evolving understanding of the Proclamation's place in our history. A fine introduction to what promises in 2013 to become a nationwide discussion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Tracing the history of the iconography of Lincoln and the Proclamation, Holzer deftly leads readers through American racial politics from the Civil War to the election of President Obama...Images of the Proclamation and political cartoons shed light on the text and its reception in 1863.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this readable and revealing book, renowned Lincoln scholar Holzer investigates the process whereby Lincoln drafted, vetted, and presented the Emancipation Proclamation and also the ways people have come to understand and use the proclamation for myriad purposes. Especially important is Holzer's demonstration that Lincoln wrapped the proclamation's revolutionary promise in "leaden" legal language to ensure its Constitutionality and its palatability to loyal slaveholders, Northerners, and others still uneasy with the prospect of ending slavery. Also instructive is Holzer's examination of the Lincoln image as the "Great Emancipator" and the kneeling slave motif in picture, sculpture, and imagination, which images have contrasted with the more contested ones of Lincoln in print. The result is a book that through close textual analysis and attention to historical context gives the Emancipation Proclamation its due and shows Lincoln as a deft politician and prose master who understood how to fit the language to the moment and thereby realize a promise for all time.

Simultaneous. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>When a great annual collection comes out, it's hard to know the reason why. Was there a bumper crop of high-quality stories, or was this year's guest editor especially gifted at winnowing out the good ones? Either way, the 2000 edition of <i>The Best American Short Stories</i> is a standout in a series that can be uneven. Its editor, E.L. Doctorow, seems to have a fondness for the "what if?" story, the kind of tale that posits an imagination-prodding question and then attempts to answer it. Nathan Englander's "The Gilgul of Park Avenue" asks: What if a WASPy financial analyst, riding in a cab one day, discovers to his surprise that he is irrevocably Jewish? In "The Ordinary Son," Ron Carlson asks: What if you are the only average person in a family of certifiable geniuses? And Allan Gurganus's "He's at the Office" asks: What if the quintessential postwar American working man were forced to retire? This last story is narrated by the man's grown son, who at the story's opening takes his dad for a walk. Though it's the present day, the father is still dressed in his full 1950s businessman regalia, including camel-hair overcoat and felt hat. The two walk by a teenager. "The boy smiled. 'Way bad look on you, guy.'" <blockquote>My father, seeking interpretation, stared at me. I simply shook my head no. I could not explain Dad to himself in terms of tidal fashion trends. All I said was "I think he likes you." </blockquote> The exchange typifies the writing showcased in this anthology: in these stories, again and again, we find a breakdown of human communication that is sprightly, humorous, and devastatingly complete. A few more of the terrific stories featured herein: Amy Bloom's "The Story," a goofy metafiction about a villainous divorcee; Geoffrey Becker's "Black Elvis," which tells of, well, a black Elvis; and Jhumpa Lahiri's "The Third and Final Continent," a story of an Indian man who moves to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Like the collection itself, Lahiri's story amasses a lovely, funny mood as it goes along. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>E.L.

In addition to writing <em>The Blessing</em> and <em>The Two Sides of Love</em> with John Trent, their book <em>The Language of Love</em> (newly revised and updated) won the Angel Award as the best contribution to family life. His national infomercial, <em>Hidden Keys to Loving Relationships</em>, has been viewed by television audiences all over the world.</p>If Only I Knew Before I approached Gary about writing a "marriage book for men," I knew his material was good, but I had no idea how meaningful it would be to me personally. After all, I had been married for almost ten years and I was nearly an "ideal husband" ... I thought. As I began to work with Gary on the material for this book, it became more and more clear that I was not a successful husband by any stretch of the imagination. I was providing for my wife's material needs and some of her physical needs, but that's where it stopped. As I got deeper into the content, I realized that for years I had been unaware of many of my wife's emotional needs. For years, she had to put up with a husband whose callousness and indifference forced her to suffer through day after day of not having her deeper needs lovingly satisfied. I am extremely grateful for all that I have learned in the past two months. At last my eyes have been opened, and I see my wife as the unique, beautiful individual that she really is. I am devoting the rest of my life to becoming the husband she deserves. The content of this book not only opened my eyes to my wife and her needs, but it gave me concrete ways to meet those needs. If you get one-tenth the value from this book that I have gleaned from its pages, it will be the most valuable book you'll ever read about marriage. Steve Scott <p>Chapter 1 How to Drive Your Wife Away Without Even Trying "You husbands likewise, live with your wives in an understanding way." 1 Peter 3:7 AT THE OTHER end of the phone a quivering voice said, "You've got to help me. She has a court order against me." George was coming to me for help after his relationship with his wife was already in shreds. "We've been married over twenty years, and she won't even let me back in the house. I can't believe she would treat me this way after all I've done for her. Can you help us get back together?" Before I answered his question, I wanted to talk to his wife. "There's no way you can talk to Barbara," he said. "She wouldn't talk to you. The moment you say you're representing me in any way, she'll hang up on you." "I've never been turned down by a wife yet," I assured him, "so we might as well see if this will be the first time. Would you give me her phone number?" To be honest, as grim as things sounded, I did wonder if she would be the first wife not willing to talk to me about her marital strife. But my doubts were unfounded&#x2014;she was more than anxious to discuss their problems. "What would it take for you to be willing to let your husband back into your life? What would have to happen before you would try to rebuild a marriage relationship with him?" Those were the same questions I had asked many wives who claimed they didn't want their husbands back. Her response was typical. "I can't possibly answer that question. He's the worst husband in the world, so I wouldn't think of taking him back. I can't stand his personality or his offensive habits any more." The court order would take care of him, she told me. "Just keep him away!" I gently asked her if she could tell me the things he had done to offend her. When I heard her response, I said, "It sounds like he hasn't been a very sensitive and gentle husband, has he?" Once again I asked her to stretch her imagination and think about what changes would be necessary before she would take him back. There was plenty of room for improvement, she told me. First, he was too domineering and critical of her. Second, he tried to control her every move with a possessive grip. Third, he trampled her sense of self-worth with constant ridicule. And fourth, although he always had time for business and other interests, he seldom took time to listen to her. On top of all that, he spied on her and didn't give her any freedom. "Don't get any ideas, though," she told me at the end of our conversation. "Because no matter what, I won't stop the divorce." When I relayed these complaints to George, I knew I had touched some sensitive spots. He defended himself and accused her. I let him rant for a while before asking, "Do you want your wife back?" "Yes, I'd do anything to get her back," he said. "Good. I'm always willing to work with someone ready to readjust his life. But if you're not totally serious, let me know now. I don't like to play games." Again he committed himself to change, but his commitment didn't last beyond my next statement. "We're going to have to work on your domineering and possessive nature. It shows you don't genuinely love your wife." He fumed and spouted, defended and fought so much I began to wonder if he really would commit himself to the necessary changes. "I've never met a more belligerent, stubborn man in my entire life!" I exclaimed. Suddenly subdued, he responded, "That's not my nature. I'm usually rather submissive inside. Maybe I'm putting up a front because I'm really not a pushy person. I feel like people run all over me." "I don't think you and I are talking about the same person," I responded. "If I were your wife, I'm not sure I could bear up emotionally under your domineering personality." That stopped him long enough for him to give our conversation some serious thought. After talking to his friends and even praying that God would help him understand, he returned to my office, able to confess his faults and ready to change.</p></p><h2>Spawn Armageddon Collection</h2><p><ul> <li>Featuring sold out issues of the most talked about <i>Spawn</i> story arc in years!

Acclaimed translator Mike O'Connor and photographer Steven Johnson uncover a world rarely seen by outsiders--even as they capture it in its everyday beauty. O'Connor's translations of poems from China's Tang Dynasty sing in the present day, while Johnson's photographs reveal a modern-day China that seems almost unchanged by the passing of centuries.<br> <br>Chinese authorities are only now allowing access to ancient Buddhist sites and many writings and devotional objects are being made available for the first time in decades. These poems written by Zen and Taoist hermit-sages, together with the crisp yet almost dreamlike images capture the aesthetic, literary, and spiritual roots of Buddhist China. <i>Where the World Does Not Follow</i> provides insight into a world that very few have been able to visit--and a time difficult even to imagine. O'Connor and Johnson's book is a hymn to nature, to the art of photography, and to the common beauty of humanity that extends to us like a silk thread from another time and place.</p><p>Steven R. Johnson is a leading photographer, specializing in landscapes of China and his work is included in books including <i>The Road to Heaven</i>."Poetry and pictures combine in <i>Where the World Does Not Follow</i>: Modern photography is married to ancient verse, creating what translator Mike O'Connor calls 'a third work, a larger whole that ideally evokes a felt sense of things beyond either words or visual representations.' Steve Johnson's black-and-white photographs emerged from his pilgrimage to the temples, huts, and caves of mountain hermit-sages, a kind of practitioner that many thought obsolete in China. The genius of this book is the timelessness that emerges from juxtaposing modern photographs with T'ang Dynasty Buddhist poetry. The photos or the poetry alone would make this a wonderful text. The two together are something truly special. Adjacent to a striking picture of Cold Mountain Cave near T'ien-t'ai Shan. Chekiang, is the poem 'On Hearing A Bell,' whose final verse captures the spirit of this work: 'In the long night of Zen meditation, when the clear bell sounded, it was my mind.'"

Not only is it aesthetically beautiful and elegantly laid out but I feel that it fills an important need for Western Zen practitioners. Most of us have not visited China and so our experiential grasp of the landscape and culture that the great Zen teachers of the Tang dynasty is limited, if not non-existent. The photographs, complemented by the poems, allow us to experience the world of Joshu and Rinzai as never before. That, surely, can only enhance our grasp of their profound teaching...

The book explores the hermit-sage tradition of China, with poems by Taoist and Buddhist adepts from the T'ang Dynasty.

A Hall of Fame hitter, Speaker compiled a career batting average of .345-career--5th all-time best and tallied more doubles than anyone in history. But Speaker was so much more than just a Hall of Fame hitter. As baseball historian Richard Johnson says, "Speaker was Willie Mays before there was Willie Mays." Regarded by his peers as the greatest center fielder of all time, Speaker's range was so great that his outfield area was known as the place "where triples went to die." He still holds the all-time records for assists, double plays, and <i>unassisted</i> double plays by an outfielder. A World Series winner as both a player and a player-manager, Speaker devised the modern-day platoon system and also the infield rotation play. The Texas native and descendant of Confederate soldiers would also go on to tutor Larry Doby, the first black man to play in the American League. <br><br>The author offers an honest look at Speaker's larger-than-life, roughshod, frontier-forged personality. Simply stated, <b>Tris Speaker</b> is the long-overdue biography of one of the best players of all time.<br></p><p><strong>2006 Seymour Medal Finalist</strong><strong></strong> Tris Speaker compiled a career batting average of .345 (4th all-time) and struck more doubles (792) than anyone in history. But he was so much more than a Hall of Fame hitter. As baseball historian Richard Johnson says, "Speaker was Willie Mays before there was a Willie Mays." Regarded by his peers as the greatest centerfielder of all-time, his glove was known as the place "where triples go to die," and he still holds career records for assists, double plays, and unassisted double plays by an outfielder. Speaker led the Boston Red Sox to two World Series championships, and then as a player-manager in Cleveland, he carried the Indians to their first-ever World Series title while also revolutionizing the game by popularizing the platoon system and the infield rotation play. Tris Speaker tells the story of one of baseball's true legends, offering an honest look at Speaker's roughshod, frontier-forged personality. As Bill Moyers once said, "Speaker was a Texan. If his flaws were large, so were his virtues." Born deep in the heart of Texas, the young Speaker would fabricate stories about his father being a Confederate hero. Yet one day, Speaker would find himself tutoring Larry Doby, the American League's first black player, on the art of playing centerfield. This long-overdue book ranks among the best in baseball biographies and in literature in the history of the game.<b>Timothy M. Gay</b> is a writer based in northern Virginia.

With conviction and certitude, he preached that repentance was a necessity for both the sinner and the righteous man. This volume presents Chrysostom's homilies on repentance and includes a sermon on almsgiving that he preached in Antioch during the winter months in 387. </p><p>Chrysostom's work reveals that repentance is an indestructible pillar of the All-Holy, Universal and Immutable Church of Christ. He believed that repentance is the liturgical tool that rejuvenates sinners and admits them into the life-giving Eucharist where they experience fully and dynamically the concrete presence of God. </p><p>The powers of repentance have rich biblical roots, and Chrysostom masterfully weaves his teaching with a plethora of Old and New Testament citings. From Scripture, the reader learns that repentance is never confined to the eucharistic context--it becomes a way of life for the believer. The daily applications of repentance, such as almsgiving, fasting, remorse over personal sins, humility, prayer, and attending Church, suggest that a person's entire life has an ecclesial character. Chrysostom preached that the whole experience of a true life in Christ is repentance that culminates in metanoia--the total change and renewal from the heart and mind of sin to "the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2:16). </p><p>In his introduction to the homilies, Fr. Gus Christo includes a succinct biography of Chrysostom within which he sets the homilies in their chronological context. He also provides an overview of repentance and discusses the ecclesiological nature of Chrysostom's theology. </p><p> "Fathers of the Church forms a core library of early Catholic literature, covering both Latin and Greek patristic writers. . . . The volumes represent the first reading of the respective works in English and a real advance in making known major examples of patristic scriptural exegesis."--Reflections </p><p>"The English reader must feel abounding gratitude to the known and unknown editors, translators, researchers, and publishers of the series 'Fathers of the Church' for the great contribution they have made by translating the Fathers of the Church into a contemporary, vibrant, and living language."--Greek Orthodox Theological Review </p><p>Begun in 1947 and now under the editorial direction of Thomas P. Halton, this popular series includes more than ninety volumes. </p><p>GUS GEORGE CHRISTO is a priest of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, under the spiritual direction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and is currently a pastor of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Lansing, Michigan. He received his B.A. in religious studies from the University of Virginia and his M.A. and Ph.D. in theology from the University of Durham, England. This volume is part of Fr. Christo's ongoing research and translation of the works of early Church Fathers, especially the works of St. John Chrysostom.</p></p><h2>Living, Loving &amp; Learning</h2><p>LIVING, LOVING AND LEARNING is a delightful collection of Dr. Buscaglia&#39;s informative and amusing lectures, which were delivered worldwide between 1970 and 1981. This inspirational treasure is for all those eager to accept the challenge of life and to profit from the wonder of love.</p><p><br>I first received the hardcover in the summer of 1982 as a going-away present from a dear, <br>dear friend who knew how much I'd enjoyed Buscaglia's work, having read some of his earlier <br>books and seen his appearances on public television. It was quite the sentimental token to <br>take along as I embarked on what turned out to be a three-year adventure in Italy. A lot of <br>my first year there was very lonely, and Buscaglia's warm, soothing words were a comfort <br>to me in my most homesick times and gave me hope. More than merely a gift from a <br>good friend, the book itself became a friend that I could turn to again and again. <br><br>Weeks after returning to the States, in December 1985, I attended a performance of Lily <br>Tomlin's Broadway show, and during the intermission, I noticed a man who could only have <br>been Leo Buscaglia chatting animatedly with a woman a few rows ahead. My heart raced; my <br>mind debated. After all, wasn't he there to enjoy himself as much as I was? Yet I had to meet <br>the man whose work had touched me so. I mustered all my courage and approached him. "I'm <br>sorry to interrupt, but are you Leo Buscaglia?" He smiled warmly as he nodded. I blanked on<br>what to say next. Finally, thinking of what I considered to be his trademark, I blurted, <br>"Could I have a hug?" It was a magical moment. The man was so loving and genuine that I knew I'd done the right thing in going up to him--plus, it was the most heartfelt hug I've ever received in my life. That really cemented the book's meaning for me.<br><br>Laurie Kahn, Associate Managing Editor<b>Leo F.

Brugioni, author of the best-selling account of the Cuban Missile crisis, <i>Eyeball to Eyeball</i>, draws on his long CIA career as one of the world's premier experts on aerial reconnaissance to provide the inside story of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's efforts to use spy planes and satellites to gather intelligence. He reveals Eisenhower to be a hands-on president who, contrary to popular belief, took an active role in assuring that the latest technology was used to gather aerial intelligence. This previously untold story of the secret Cold War program makes full use of the author's firsthand knowledge of the program and of information he gained from interviews with important participants. As a founder and senior officer of the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center, Brugioni was a key player in keeping Eisenhower informed of developments, and he sheds new light on the president's contributions toward building an effective and technologically advanced intelligence organization.<br><p>The book provides details of the president's backing of the U-2's development and its use to dispel the bomber gap and to provide data on Soviet missile and nuclear efforts and to deal with crises in the Suez, Lebanon, Chinese Off Shore Islands, Tibet, Indonesia, East Germany, and elsewhere. Brugioni offers new information about Eisenhower's order of U-2 flights over Malta, Cyprus, Toulon, and Israel and subsequent warnings to the British, French, and Israelis that the U.S. would not support an invasion of Egypt. He notes that the president also backed the development of the CORONA photographic satellite, which eventually proved the missile gap with the Soviet Union didn't exist, and a variety of other satellite systems that detected and monitored problems around the world. The unsung reconnaissance roles played by Jimmy Doolittle and Edwin Land are also highlighted in this revealing study of Cold War espionage.</p></p><p>Dino A. Brugioni is a retired CIA analyst and worked as one of the founders of the National Photographic Interpretation Center established by the agency in 1955. In that capacity he served as Senior Officer and briefed Presidents from Eisenhower through Ford.

Goulden, The Washington Times</p><h2>Journeys on the Silk Road: A Desert Explorer, Buddha&#39;s Secret Library, And The Unearthing Of The World&#39;s Oldest Printed Book</h2><p>When a Chinese monk broke into a hidden cave in 1900, he uncovered one of the world&#x2019;s great literary secrets: a time capsule from the ancient Silk Road. Inside, scrolls were piled from floor to ceiling, undisturbed for a thousand years. The gem within was the Diamond Sutra of AD 868. This key Buddhist teaching, made 500 years before Gutenberg inked his press, is the world&#x2019;s oldest printed book.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Silk Road once linked China with the Mediterranean. It conveyed merchants, pilgrims and ideas. But its cultures and oases were swallowed by shifting sands. Central to the Silk Road&#x2019;s rediscovery was a man named Aurel Stein, a Hungarian-born scholar and archaeologist employed by the British service.<br>&nbsp;<br>Undaunted by the vast Gobi Desert, Stein crossed thousands of desolate miles with his fox terrier Dash. Stein met the Chinese monk and secured the Diamond Sutra and much more. The scroll&#x2019;s journey&#x2014;by camel through arid desert, by boat to London&#x2019;s curious scholars, by train to evade the bombs of World War II&#x2014;merges an explorer&#x2019;s adventures, political intrigue, and continued controversy.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Diamond Sutra has inspired Jack Kerouac and the Dalai Lama. Its journey has coincided with the growing appeal of Buddhism in the West. As the Gutenberg Age cedes to the Google Age, the survival of the Silk Road&#x2019;s greatest treasure is testament to the endurance of the written word.<br><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p>Joyce Morgan's work has appeared in <i>The Australian, The Guardian,</i> <i>The Bangkok Post,</i> and <i>The Sydney Morning Herald. </i>She has also worked as a producer with ABC Radio.

Morgan and Conrad allow the reader to accomplish the next best thing. In this expressive account, they and, by proxy, we follow the footsteps of archeologist Aurel Stein as he explores the remains of cultures along the ancient trade route known as the Silk Road. Traveling this legendary trail in the early years of the twentieth century, the intrepid Stein made discoveries that rival the great tombs of Egypt in sheer beauty and human achievement, to say nothing of in terms of the evidence of remarkable commingling of East and West in commerce, art, and philosophy. The excitement mounts as Stein faces strife and competition to unearth and claim such rare antiquities as the Diamond Sutra, a printed paper book predating the Gutenberg Bible by 600 years. The good if somewhat worrisome news is that these invaluable sites, long reserved for the most elite traveler, have become easily accessible and hugely popular. --Donna Chavez</p><h2>Wolverine: Origins, Vol. 2: Savior</h2><p>As Wolverine&#39;s true memories of his past are restored, he finds himself facing a foe from his old espionage days, the Soviet menace Omega Red.</p><p></p><h2>Three Views on Creation and Evolution (Counterpoints)</h2><p><p>For Christians, the issues raised by the different views on creation and evolution are challenging. Can a "young earth" be reconciled with a universe that appears to be billions of years old? Does scientific evidence point to a God who designed the universe and life in all its complexity? Three Views on Creation and Evolution deals with these and similar concerns as it looks at three dominant schools of Christian thought. Proponents of young earth creationism, old earth creationism, and theistic evolution each present their different views, tell why the controversy is important, and describe the interplay between their understandings of science and theology. Each view is critiqued by various scholars, and the entire discussion is summarized by Phillip E. Johnson and Richard H. Bube. The Counterpoints series provides a forum for comparison and critique of different views on issues important to Christians. Counterpoints books address two categories: Church Life and Bible and Theology.

Now, Antonia Fraser goes behind the well-known tales of Louis&#x2019;s accomplishments and follies, exploring in riveting detail his intimate relationships with women.<br><br>The king&#x2019;s mother, Anne of Austria, had been in a childless marriage for twenty-two years before she gave birth to Louis XIV. A devout Catholic, she instilled in her son a strong sense of piety and fought successfully for his right to absolute power. In 1660, Louis married his first cousin, Marie-Th�r�se, in a political arrangement. While unfailingly kind to the official Queen of Versailles, Louis sought others to satisfy his romantic and sexual desires. After a flirtation with his sister-in-law, his first important mistress was Louise de La Valli�re, who bore him several children before being replaced by the tempestuous and brilliant Ath�na�s, marquise de Montespan. Later, when Ath�na�s&#x2019;s reputation was tarnished, the King continued to support her publicly as Ath�na�s left court for a life of repentance. Meanwhile her children&#x2019;s governess, the intelligent and seemingly puritanical Fran�oise de Maintenon, had already won the King&#x2019;s affections; in a relationship in complete contrast to his physical obsession with Ath�na�s, Louis XIV lived happily with Madame de Maintenon for the rest of his life, very probably marrying her in secret. When his grandson&#x2019;s child bride, the enchanting Adelaide of Savoy, came to Versaille she lightened the King&#x2019;s last years &#x2013; until tragedy struck.<br><br>With consummate skill, Antonia Fraser weaves insights into the nature of women&#x2019;s religious lives &#x2013; as well as such practical matters as contraception &#x2013; into her magnificent, sweeping portrait of the king, his court, and his ladies.</p><p>Antonia Fraser has written such acclaimed and bestselling historical works such as <b>Mary Queen of Scots</b>, and three highly praised books on women in history, including <b>The Warrior Queens</b> and <b>The Wives of Henry VIII</b>.

When Louis, her first child, was born on 5 September 1638 the Spanish-born Queen of France was just short of her thirty-seventh birthday. This was an age at which a royal princess might well expect to be a grandmother (Anne herself had been married at fourteen). The Queen had on the contrary endured twenty-two years of childless union. Anne, as she told a confidante, had even feared the annulment of her marriage, since childlessness was one possible ground for repudiation according to the Catholic Church. In which case the former Spanish Princess, daughter of Philip III, would either have been returned to her native country or possibly dispatched to govern the so-called &#x2018;Spanish&#x2019; Netherlands (approximately modern Belgium), as other princesses of her royal house had done, most recently her pious aunt, Isabella Clara Eugenia.<br><br>The birth of a child, and that child a son &#x2014; females could not inherit in France under the fourteenth-century Salic Law &#x2014; meant that the whole position of his royal mother was transformed. It was not only the obvious delight of a woman confronted with &#x2018;a marvel when it was least expected&#x2019;, as the official newspaper <i>Gazette de France </i>put it. It was also the traditionally strong position of any Queen of France who had produced a Dauphin, an interesting paradox in the land of the Salic Law. This strength derived from the claim of such a Queen to act as Regent should her husband die during the minority of her son; a rule which had applied to Louis XIII&#x2019;s mother when Henri IV had died, and the dominating Catherine de M�dicis in the previous century. <br><br>It was a situation that had already been envisaged at the time of Anne of Austria&#x2019;s betrothal in 1612. In poetical language the future Queen was described as the moon to her husband&#x2019;s sun: &#x2018;Just as the moon borrows its light from the sun . . .&#x2019; the monarch&#x2019;s death means that &#x2018;the setting sun gives way to the moon and confers on it the power of shedding light in its absence&#x2019;. (The potential bride and bridegroom were then both ten years old.) A quarter of a century later, the reality was less poetical. Louis XIII was not in good health and a Regency in the next thirteen years &#x2014; the age at which a French King reached his majority &#x2014; was more likely than not. How long would it be before Anne, like Catherine de M�dicis, was promoting herself as an image of revered maternality at the heart of government?<br><br>Furthermore the dynastic map of Europe was transformed. The heir presumptive to the throne of France, the King&#x2019;s younger brother Gaston Duc d&#x2019;Orl�ans, on being shown &#x2018;physical proofs&#x2019; of the baby&#x2019;s masculinity, had to accept that his rising hopes of accession had been fatally dashed. But Gaston himself had only daughters. Next in line were the French Princes of the Blood, notably the Prince de Cond� and his two sons the Duc d&#x2019;Enghien and the Prince de Conti; their hopes were similarly blighted.<br><br>On the other hand the birth of a prince not only cut off hopes but also instigated ambitious thoughts of his eventual marriage to a princess. Gaston&#x2019;s daughter by his first marriage, Anne-Marie-Louise de Montpensier, was the richest heiress in France from the fortune of her mother who had died at her birth. She did not allow an eleven-year gap in age to prevent her dallying with thoughts of the Dauphin as &#x2018;my little husband&#x2019;. Even more significant for the future was another equally august birth in Spain. Five days after the ecstatic Queen Anne gave birth to Louis, her sister-in-law, wife of Philip IV, gave birth to a princess.<br><br>These two high-born babies were in fact double first cousins (with identical grandparents), since a brother and a sister of France had married a brother and a sister of Spain. Unlike France, however, Spain allowed females to succeed: Anne of Austria had had to renounce her own rights on her marriage. There was at least a theoretical possibility that the Infanta Maria Teresa would one day succeed to the throne of Spain &#x2014; or her children would. Another theoretical possibility, always present in the mind of Queen Anne, was that Maria Teresa might one day make a bride for Louis. <br><br>Under the circumstances, it is easy to understand how the infant Louis was described as &#x2018;Dieudonn�&#x2019; or &#x2018;Deodatus&#x2019;: Godgiven. And even as the years passed, the apparently miraculous nature of his conception and birth was never forgotten. One German diplomat would refer to the King&#x2019;s &#x2018;quite extraordinary birth&#x2019; over forty years after the event.<br>How miraculous was this birth, so unexpected and so awe-inspiring for the mother? Certainly a great deal of prayer had been applied to the subject as the years passed. There were pilgrimages to shrines, as befitted a Queen who throughout her life liked nothing so much as to visit convents and holy places. Saint Leonard was invoked against sterility; a hermit who was believed to have founded a monastery near Limoges in the sixth century, his intercession was held responsible for many miracles. (He was otherwise the patron saint of prisoners &#x2014; and after all the Queen was in the prison of her infertility.)<br><br>The Queen was fast approaching the age at which child-bearing itself was felt to be unlikely. This was a period when women were generally held to age faster than men, losing their bloom early &#x2014; &#x2018;no woman is beautiful after twenty-two&#x2019; was a popular saying &#x2014; going further downhill after thirty. Certainly, by the time of the Queen&#x2019;s thirty-sixth birthday on 22 September 1637 &#x2014; and thirty-five was often seen as a cut-off point &#x2014; her relationship with her husband, and also with her adopted country of France, had already had a long and troubled history.<br><br>The marriage of the two royal teenagers took place on the feast of St Catherine &#x2014; 25 November &#x2014; 1615. It was, it seems, consummated immediately, and after that there was a gap of more than three years. The twenty-fifth of January 1619 was the auspicious date on which the further completion of the royal union was announced in the gazette <i>Mercure Fran�ais</i> (it was after all a matter of state, just as the marriage had been). There were certainly rumours of royal pregnancies throughout the 1620s, and Louis XIII himself told the Venetian Ambassador later that his Queen had had four &#x2018;wretched miscarriages&#x2019;.<br><br>If the marriage was not egregiously unhappy by royal standards &#x2014; notoriously low &#x2014; it was certainly unhappy enough. Anne was an extremely attractive, even beautiful woman with her full, voluptuous figure, her thick bright chestnut hair, her luminous pale skin and her dark eyes with the green glints which gave them a special sparkle. She had her share of feminine vanity and was especially proud of her much-admired white hands, which seemed made &#x2018;to hold a sceptre&#x2019;. As for her character, that was made up of contradictions. Anne was certainly pleasure-loving &#x2014; she adored the theatre and gambling &#x2014; but at the same time she was extremely pious.<br><br>Her piety did not stop Queen Anne from being a romantic, and it was not difficult for men to fall in love with her: &#x2018;her smile won a thousand hearts,&#x2019; wrote Madame de Motteville, her lady-in-waiting. She was also <i>galante</i> in the crucial French term of the time which shimmers with different meanings throughout this period. In the case of the Queen, it meant flirtatious in the courtly, essentially innocent manner of the well-chaperoned Spanish Infanta she had once been. When the handsome Duke of Buckingham, who was gallant in every sense of the word, had &#x2018;the audacity&#x2019; to court her in a famous scene in a garden, the Queen recoiled in horror. Nevertheless, in the opinion of Madame de Motteville, an important source for Anne&#x2019;s intimate feelings because she understood the Spanish world, &#x2018;if a respectable woman could love a man other than her husband, it would have been Buckingham who appealed to her&#x2019;. The Princesse de Conti had a more cynical view: she would vouch for the Queen&#x2019;s virtue from the waist down, but not from the waist up.<br><br>The sexuality of the husband of this romantic and unfulfilled woman was what would now be called troubled. Louis XIII formed lugubrious attachments to both men and women: late in his life, the Marquis de Cinq-Mars became his favourite. But at one point<br>Louis fell yearningly in love with Marie d&#x2019;Hautefort (his conjugal visits to Anne were said to have increased in consequence). However, when his friend the Duc de Saint-Simon offered to act as a go-between, the King was shocked: &#x2018;the more my rank as king gives me the facility to satisfy myself,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;the more I must guard against sin and scandal.&#x2019; Low-spirited and willingly dominated by his great minister Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII was one half of an incompatible pair.<br><br>Furthermore, if the marriage did not provide a Bourbon&#x2014;Habsburg heir, it did not bring about peace between Bourbon and Habsburg kingdoms either. Not long after Anne came to France, the slow strangulation of Europe in that long and complicated conflict known later as the Thirty Years War began. In this conflict, at the instigation of Cardinal Richelieu, the French and Spanish found themselves on different sides. Anne rejected the idea that she remained at heart a Spanish princess. Her tastes might be Spanish, from a predilection for late hours to a yearning for Spanish iced drinks and Spanish chocolate, but she prided h...</p><h2>The Misunderstanding</h2><p>Yves Harteloup is a disappointed young man, old money fallen on hard times, who returns for the summer to the rich, comfortable Atlantic resort of Hendaye, where he spent idyllic childhood holidays. He becomes infatuated by a beautiful young woman, Denise, whose rich husband is often away on business. Yves seduces Denise and leaves her intensely, jealously in love, as he returns to the office at the end of the summer. <br><br>Yet in the mournful Paris autumn their love flounders. As Denise is driven mad with desire and suspicion, Yves seems to back off emotionally and, suffocated by her passion, he asks her to leave him alone for a while. This moment of misunderstanding is the turning point: he believes she has understood his needs, but beneath the surface she is delirious with anguish, now mixed with a sour bitterness.<br><br>With a biting satirical eye and a characteristic perception for the fault lines in human relationships, Ir�ne N�mirovsky's first novel shows sure signs of the brilliant novelist she was later to become.</p><p>IR�NE N�MIROVSKY was born in Kiev in 1903, the daughter of a successful Jewish banker.

She is author of the Watercolour Artist&#39;s Pocket Palette.Feb 07 This is such a good idea that it&#39;s been copied and adapted many times since this book first appeared in 1991. Even then, it wasn&#39;t necessarily the first time this had been done, but the simplicity with which it&#39;s presented makes this by far the best manifestation of the genre. Quarto, the book packaging company, have always been at the forefront of illustrated instructional book design in a number of fields, and it&#39;s a tribute to their skills that this can be reprinted untouched and remain as fresh today as it was when it first appeared 15 years ago. Divided by colour type, what you get is a series of colour swatches made from two-part mixes with, in most cases, gradations of hue and tint. To keep things interesting, each chapter also includes an example painting with a short explanation of how various details, such as shadows, were achieved by the use of colour. The secret of the book is its simplicity and the fact that it doesn&#39;t attempt to be overly comprehensive (for that, you want The Watercolour Artist&#39;s Colour Mixing Bible) or more instructional than it needs to be. Even so, you get a guide to over 800 colour mixes that you can find quickly and replicate at will. The book is only 64 pages long, will fit in a pocket and is also a spiral bound hardback that will lay flat in use, so even the format is well thought-out. The only possible drawback is that the colours are pre-printed and therefore subject to the limitations of the printing process, but that won&#39;t detain you long as the reproduction is excellent. If you want something really faithful, then you need the Michael Wilcox books, but you need to complete those yourself and they require a considerable investment in time.

Lesage, with her innate knowledge of French culture, uses previously unknown or untranslated sources to provide a unique look into French society and Wharton&#x2019;s place within it. <br><p><br><i>Edith Wharton in France</i> chronicles Edith Wharton&#x2019;s dogged efforts to penetrate the Byzantine levels of French high society, her love for the French and Italian countryside, and her consuming passion for the Mediterranean garden. While Lesage is initially skeptical of Wharton&#x2019;s ability to &#x201c;become French,&#x201d; this work ultimately portrays a woman of indomitable spirit who ultimately succeeds in fashioning a French home of her own making in her beloved adopted country.<br></p><p><br>Lesage&#x2019;s work illuminates the intertwined characters and important relationships of Wharton&#x2019;s life in France, many of them overlooked or minimized in earlier biographies. Prominently featured in the account are the French novelist Paul Bourget and his wife Minnie, whose meticulous diary entries over a 35-year period provide a fresh look at Wharton&#x2019;s active social life both in Paris and on the French Riviera.<br></p><p><br>A still more intimate look into Wharton&#x2019;s French circle is provided by her extensive correspondence with the Frenchman L�on B�lugou, a widely travelled mining engineer, writer and well-known figure in Parisian high society. Spanning more than 25 years, the letters portray a mutual intellectual kinship and devoted friendship. Other newly discovered highlights include letters presented as evidence in Wharton&#x2019;s French divorce proceedings, a mysterious autobiographical essay written by Wharton&#x2019;s lover, American journalist Morton Fullerton, and numerous photographs never before published. <br></p><p><br>The author of multiple works of translation, as well original French texts on Wharton and Conrad, Lesage had access to unexamined and untranslated French sources. She presents Wharton&#x2019;s life from the perspective of a native French woman, capturing a unique view of Wharton trying to navigate through the ancient layers of French society and master its often maddeningly obscure rules, all the while commenting on the horrors of World War I and the cataclysmic changes in the arts and culture of Paris.</p></p><p>The French author Claudine Lesage, n�e Holuigue, was born in 1943. She obtained a Ph.D. in English Literature at Amiens in 1987, specializing in the works of Joseph Conrad. Lesage published several books about Conrad: La maison de Th�r�se (1992), Joseph Conrad et le Continent (2003), and translations of his works: Le Forban (2005), Du go�t des voyages (2007), and Coeur des T�n�bres (2009).<br>In 1989, while researching Conrad at the library of the C�te d&#x2019;Azur town of Hy�res, Lesage discovered an unsigned manuscript that appeared to be an early work of Edith Wharton. After studying the manuscript, Lesage determined it was an unpublished account of Wharton&#x2019;s 1888 Mediterranean cruise aboard the private yacht, The Vanadis.<br><p><br>After publishing the journal as The Cruise of the Vanadis, Lesage probed further into Wharton&#x2019;s work and her life, concentrating on the American writer&#x2019;s French years. Lesage translated several Wharton short stories; edited Lettres a l'ami Francais (2001); and authored Edith Wharton en France (2011).<br></p><p><br>Dr. Lesage died in 2013 before she could publish her final manuscript, a work on Wharton&#x2019;s life in France intended for an American audience.</p>&#x201c;In this smooth English translation, Claudine Lesage&#x2019;s <i>Edith Wharton in France</i> provides essential reading for lovers of Wharton&#x2019;s novels.

Its unifying theme--the measure of autonomy to be accorded indigenous ethnic groups--spans formats as different as poems, eyewitness accounts of last year's fighting, interviews with a union leader and with the rebellion's leader Marcos, supporting words from Leonard Peltier (the Sioux convicted--unjustly he claims--of killing FBI agents), and perspectives on the revolutionaries' challenge to global economic structures like GATT and NAFTA from academicians such as Noam Chomsky. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>The Mexican Zapatista Army's march in 1994 provoked a national crisis in the country, challenging current trends in Mexican politics and management or social concerns.

How can you best handle their responses? Here's a children's book and parenting tool rolled into one. <i>It's Not Your Fault, Koko Bear</i> is a picture book designed to be read by parents to their children. Koko Bear's parents are getting a divorce, and Koko, a preschool-aged unisex bear, isn't happy about it. "I don't like this divorce. I don't want two homes," Koko says. Koko Bear's story doesn't minimize kids' pain, but it doesn't wallow in it either. The message is positive: children are reassured that their feelings are natural, that their parents still love and will care for them, and that the divorce is not their fault. At the bottom of each page, there are bullet points for parents that give information and advice about what the kids are going through, and the best way to handle each issue as it arises. <i>(Ages 3 to 7 and parents)</i>PreSchool-Grade 2AKoKo Bear's parents are getting divorced, and the cub must go through many adjustments and deal with a wide range of emotions: anger, guilt, confusion, and sadness. At every step, MaMa and PaPa are helpful, understanding, and supportive. In fact, Lansky's introduction for parents notes that adults might think they "are unrealistically polite and even-tempered." However, this is a book with a purpose, and as such, plot and character take a backseat to message. Below each block of text are comments and suggestions for adults to deal with issues raised by that section of the story. The illustrations are similarly low-key and pleasant, adding to the overall sense of well being. As bibliotherapy, this book serves a purpose. It might be shelved with the author's Divorce Book for Parents (Book Peddlers, 1991) as well as in the juvenile section.AKathy Piehl, Mankato State University, MN<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Understand, Enjoy, and Draw Optical Illusions: 37 Illustrated Projects</h2><p>This manual attempts to explore a wide variety of optical illusions from a designer&#39;s point of view.

They only look complex! This updated version of Charlene Schurch's previous collection includes her original designs plus new versions of several mittens.</p><ul><li>Mittens are knit in the round and include a thumb gore for excellent fit</li><li>Collection features patterns for 35 pairs of mittens plus four traditional hats</li><li>Projects use stranded color work and include easy-to-follow color-coded charts</li></ul></p><p><p>Charlene Schurch is the author of a growing number of knitting books and numerous magazine articles about knitting and spinning. Her articles have appeared in <i>Vogue Knitting</i>, <i>Knitters</i>, <i>Interweave Knits</i>, <i>Piecework</i>, and <i>SpinOff</i>. She divides her time between Connecticut and Florida.</p>If you're looking for something different in mittens, check out Charlene Schurch's Mostly Mittens: Ethnic Knitting Designs from Russia (Martingale &amp; Company, 2009). This is a revised edition of the book originally published in 1998; errors have been corrected and hat patterns have been added. The patterns were inspired by Schurch's discovery of patterns in the clothing of the Komi people. The Komi are people who live west of the Urals and close to the Arctic Circle. A recognized Russian minority, Komi heritage can be traced to the Finns and Estonians.<br>The patterns may remind knitters somewhat of Latvian designs. They are colorful and geometric. They can be complex or relatively simple.<br>After a brief history of the Komi, Schurch provides basic guidelines for knitting mittens. She provides readers with guidelines for selecting yarn and needles, how to measure gauge, and how to cast on and begin to knit in the round. Multiple cuff styles are described. This is followed by an explanation on how to read charts. There are 35 mitten patterns included in the book. Each project includes 2 thumb sizes, medium and large, for ease in knitting mittens for most of those on your must knit-for list.<br>In addition to the mittens, there are 4 cap projects. Schurch also tells you how to adapt the mitten stitch/color patterns for sweaters and how to use the pattern of your choice to design a cap. The patterns are written for DPNs, but she does tell you how to adapt them for knitting on 2 circular needles. She does not mention using the Magic Loop method of circular knitting, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't be used. The projects can also be knit flat and seamed.<br>I've generally advised knitters not to put too much emphasis on the skill levels indicated on patterns. In this case, however, I'd recommend that you've knit at least 1 pair before taking on these. That way, you'll be familiar with the basic structure and knitting of mittens. Included in the book are instructions for the basic mitten. Though the pattern refers to knitting from the chart, there's no reason why you couldn't knit them in a single color, stockinette, and get the feel for the mitten-knitting process.<br>Knitters will refer to the previously mentioned basic mitten pattern throughout the book, as the instructions for the individual mittens assume you're familiar with the process. The charts are large enough to read and easy to follow.<br>If you're a mitten or cap knitter, or if you're interested in ethnic knitting, Mostly Mittens: Ethnic Knitting Designs from Russia will be a nice addition to your library. And the resulting projects will be a colorful and impressive addition to your knitting repertoire. --Ida Walker, knit-a-while.com<br><br>Sometimes a knitting book comes along that you just have to have. Sometimes it's the pretty pictures, or because you saw someone else on Ravelry had knit something out of it, or sometimes you just need the book because you have recently developed an obsession for wanting to knit things like what can be found in the book. <br><br>Enter Mostly Mittens by Charlene Schurch. <br><br>This book was originally published in 1998. From what I can gather it must have gone out of print, because that original publishing is available on Amazon for $72!<br><br>Mostly Mittens is a book that specifically focuses on the ethnic knitting designs from Russia (hence the subtitle). More specifically, it focuses on those of the Komi people, a group of people who settled in the northeast part of Russia near the Arctic Circle in about 1700 (according to the book). <br><br>This book does a very good job of going into the history of the Komi, their knitting and their influence on knitting traditions. It also discusses the Komi patterns and what the characteristics of these patterns are. I actually really enjoyed this part of the book. I knew from looking at the patterns that things looked a little different than other Fair Isle mittens I have seen. Something about the geometry of the patterns is different. I really liked that there was explanation for this in the book. I don't normally care a lot about the history of knitting (which maybe is bad of me, but usually I am more concerned with the question of "is it pretty?" instead of "how did it come to be?"), but this time I was glad it was there.<br><br>But let's get into what everyone really cares about: the patterns! The book is broken down into six sections based on the type of mitten (from Basic Mittens all the way to Complex Borders, and even a few hat patterns made their way into the book). Each pattern has a full color picture of the mitten and then the usual yarn, gauge, needle size info. After that is a brief written instruction for the cuff and then goes straight into the colorwork of the mitten. The chart for the hand and thumb is in the book in landscape format, which makes it very easy to read (no flipping over pages back and forth, all the charts are on one page).<br><br>Some of my favorite mittens in the book are Mitten 4, 9, 11, 20 and 24 (not the best name for mittens, but at least they are easy to locate in the book!)<br><br>The patterns call for fingering weight yarn and the needles to go along with that weight of yarn (US 0-3). Not too bad for people that like to knit socks and things on teeny needles.<br><br>I would recommend this book to an intermediate knitter. If you hate charts, then you need to steer clear of this book. The book is pretty much all charts. But, if you are a lover of knitting charts then I think you might like this book. I would say this book is best suited for someone who has knitted some kind of Fair Isle before and loves those charts. Sounds like a book for me! --Jennifer Hansen, knittinglikecrazy.com<br><br>Mostly Mittens starts off with a very interesting (brief) summary of the history of the Komi people, why they knit in the fair isle style, how the patterns came around, and lots of very interesting history about this fantastic art. The book is basically all knitting graphs. A knitting graph is like graph paper with squares filled in to represent which stitch is knit in which color. There are basic instructions at the beginning of the book, then each pattern gives the tools needed and the graph, but the basic instructions are the same for all of them. <br><br>The patterns are all unique and intricate, but very easy to follow once you understand what you're doing. Fair Isle is very relaxing and fun, not to mention warm since the extra threads add a second, third, and at times a fourth layer of warmth to the mittens. <br><br>Many knitting books try to teach people how to knit, or try to offer pictures and explanations of certain more advanced stitches in knitting. This one does not--and it's something I appreciate. The book is aimed for the educated knitter who knows how to use double-pointed needles, read a pattern, and understand the difference between an inc 1 and a M1, etc. It's nice to read a book that is aimed for the level I'm at, rather than one that tries to take a brand-new knitter and make them a pro overnight. There is a list of abbreviations in the back, because all knitters abbreviate slightly different. There's also a list of resources in the back. <br><br>My only complaint is that the basic instructions aren't written in a very clear manner, nor are the instructions for the knit-on cast-on. Luckily the photos and drawings are wonderful, and you can pretty much understand the concept. Plus, if you're using this book, you are already pretty experienced. <br><br>In the back there are four hat patterns, and instructions to take the mitten graphs and turn them into hats! With 36 mitten graphs, 4 sets of hats, and a million color variations, imagine what you could do with this book! It makes my fingers twitch and my mouth water. I've got to get me some fingering weight wool and size two double-pointed needles... <br><br>Recommendation: intermediate to experienced knitters who don't mind using small needles. No size 15 for these! Size 0-3 are the ones you'll use. --Haleyknitz blog</p><h2>Nelson&#39;s Compact Series: Compact Bible Commentary</h2><p><ul><li>Attractive abridgement of <em>Nelson's New Illustrated Bible Commentary</em></li><li>Makes the Bible's "Then and There" become the "Here and Now" of God's Word today</li></ul></p><p>Ronald B.

His action would change the course of the twentieth century.<br><br>Gouzenko&#x2019;s defection sent shockwaves through Washington, London, Moscow, and Ottawa. It was the first from a Soviet Embassy, and the smuggled documents, which suggested that agents in North America were feeding atomic secrets to Moscow, sparked a witch-hunt for spies, including not only Americans and Canadians, but a leading British nuclear scientist, Allan Nunn May.<br> <br>FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover used Gouzenko&#x2019;s defection to demonize the Soviets and discredit the leftists in President Harry Truman&#x2019;s White House. All he had needed to push his agenda was evidence of spying, and Gouzenko delivered the goods. The FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee used Gouzenko&#x2019;s revelations to go after Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, and many others. And all the while, infamous MI-5 double-agent Kim Philby kept his Soviet masters apprised. The Cold War had truly begun.<br><br>In this first book to tell the Gouzenko story, Amy Knight uses newly declassified files as well as interviews with several of the key players to examine the substance of Gouzenko&#x2019;s revelations and delve into his hidden motives for defecting. She explains how Gouzenko was really a pawn in a much larger game. And she brilliantly connects these events to the hardening of relations between Moscow and the West, the practice of guilt by association, and the end of the movement for international control of the atomic bomb.</p><p><b>Amy Knight</b> has a Ph.D. in Russian politics from the London School of Economics. She has been a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington, and is a world expert in Soviet and Russian security services. She has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. Her four previous books, <i>The KGB: Police and Politics in the Soviet Union</i> (1988), <i>Beria: Stalin&#x2019;s First Lieutenant</i> (1993), <i>Spies Without Cloaks: The KGB Successors</i> (1996), and <i>Who Killed Kirov? The Kremlin&#x2019;s Greatest Mystery</i> (1999), have all received prominent international attention.Igor Gouzenko was presented to the West as a man of courage who did a great service in opening up the eyes of the world to Soviet treachery. But like most defectors, Gouzenko is more complicated than that. The popularly accepted account of his defection and the subsequent investigation leaves many unanswered questions. Was Gouzenko really a hero? Those who were accused unjustly of spying, and who had their names and reputations tarnished for life as a result, viewed Gouzenko as an opportunist whose word should never have been trusted. But was it really his fault that his allegations were used for the purposes of <i>realpolitik</i>? Once he made his pact with Western intelligence services, much of what Gouzenko did or said was out of his control.<br><br>To understand Gouzenko&#x2019;s historical legacy, we must go back to the beginning, to that fateful day in September 1945 when he walked out of the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa with a sheaf of secret documents. What motivated this obscure young cipher clerk to betray his country and embark on what would become a life of fear, acclaim, and, eventually, frustration and poverty? What evidence did he actually produce to show that there was such a massive Soviet spy ring in North America? And what were the driving forces that led Western government officials and politicians to seize on Gouzenko&#x2019;s allegations and engage in an unprecedented struggle against the communist menace?<br><br>For decades, much of the official documentation on the Gouzenko affair in Canada, Britain, and the United States was kept under wraps as part of long-�standing secrecy regulations. But government files in all three countries have opened up, and recently the intelligence services of Canada and Britain have released an impressive amount of exciting new evidence. In 2003, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (csis), at this author&#x2019;s request, declassified hundreds of rcmp Gouzenko documents, and at the end of that year the British made a large portion of their mi5 Gouzenko file publicly available. It is now possible to document, for the first time, the details of the defection and the response of the allied governments, and to examine the impact of the case in the years that followed. And thanks to &#x201c;glasnost,&#x201d; we now can learn about the impact of the Gouzenko affair in the Soviet Union, the turmoil it created in the Kremlin, and the repercussions it had for the Soviet intelligence apparatus.<br><br>In chronicling Gouzenko&#x2019;s story, this book renews a debate that began in the McCarthy era and divides historians to this day. To what extent were the people accused of passing secrets to the Soviets during the 1940s really spies, and to what extent were they merely individuals sympathetic to the communist cause and unwittingly drawn into the Soviet espionage network? Another important question, one that resonates particularly strongly in today&#x2019;s post-�September 11 world, is whether the harm that was done to Western interests by those who did spy justified the widespread abuse of individual rights, the vast expenditures of public resources, and the shattering of so many innocent lives. Was the Gouzenko affair necessary to open up our eyes to the evils of the Soviet empire, or did the defection produce an overreaction that polarized Western society and diverted Western governments from a more reasoned and productive response to Soviet espionage as we gradually came to understand its capabilities and aims? Can we say today, with over fifty years of hindsight and a vast amount of new archival documentation, that the Cold War, as fought by the West against Soviet espionage in the early post-�war years, was worth fighting? This book aims to answer these questions.</p><h2>SPRAWL</h2><p><p>&#x201c;SPRAWL in fact does not sprawl at all; rather, it radiates with control and fresh, strange reflection.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Bookforum</em></p><p>&#x201c;Reads as if Gertrude Stein channeled Alice B.

Each new day there is the coming through of sunlight between the oaks. Things fall and because of this there is a kind of discontinuous innovation. What influences the Richardsons? What influences the Saintsburys? The two questions go hand in hand. How do we cope with the privacy of various domestic characters? The letter, of course, the familiar letter, we employ it. Dear Mrs. Barbauld, It is primarily for the sake of your re-orientation to our town that I write to you today. There are more interesting letters, of course. There are no doubt letters with unreserved emotions, just as there are many ways of communicating that are, especially in retrospect, alien to one's own individual experience. It's difficult enough to take in the results, all the sordid aspects. Only gauge what's arisen during old Mr. Anderson's lifetime! The changes have imposed themselves on our features. What does it signify? Flowers, birds, churches, planes, resorts, malls, green places. Industrial clusters and country houses. Today I fell asleep in the tall grass near the old train station. It was a complete picture. A fashionable park. Yet the picture had its sordid and selfish aspect. I can't seem to say what I mean, Mrs. Barbauld, but with some urgency I mean to inform you what a triumph the big city has become. I am a secular individual but even I can feel the shift in the horizon utterly alien to the constitution of things, the habitual. Sincerely, etc. I move in shade on the edge of a parking lot under walnut trees in the early morning around the edge of a curve in an accidental manner. I walk&nbsp;the sidewalk and ripple the surface of it. From this condition I have a view of the world. Magazines provide images of half-cooked food products. Glazed and slick they seduce us like any raw material. Books offer helpful suggestions about how to lead our lives (let the kitchen sparkle, become fully insured, do not approach the sidelines). On the evening news the periphery is always in decline, but we are able to project our own great men into its material present as if extending ourselves into other cultures&#x2014;an archipelago somewhere west of Hawaii (and pineapple rings on grilled hot dogs make "Hilo Franks"). After this we return to normative-centralizing activities, such as the time we made a replica of our town out of sugar cubes, or when we gathered to string garland around every phone booth on Main Street. But Haywood defends himself against my moral intrusions. He stands in the kitchen holding a knife and a mushroom. He says, "Clothe your instructions in less abstract examples." He is angry because he was raised to be a substantial Protestant, with stories of utility to tell the women, and relevance. Without it he gets cranky. I prevail. I appear to be free from design or discretion. It is an easy discovery of the "feminine." I walk through the doorway wearing my aggressively orange hat. I do it over and over. I do it as a kind of series and then I do it in reverse. I do it as an indicator of a particular lifestyle, to redefine myself and exclude others. First I do it in a red pantsuit and then I do it in the nude. I do it and I say, "I doubt it." I twirl a little when I do it. I do it and am striking when I do it because I do it in a frilly dress like meringue. Afterwards, we eat bread, corn,&nbsp;cupcakes, cheese, and two chickens, and then we argue about it. We ingest liquids and a bunch of different fruits. Together we forget where we parked the car. We go into houses to witness the presentations. Domestic life appeals to us as well rounded. When we lick each other we do it without any sense of "before" or "nowhere," so you can see we do it as suggested. Also, we worry for money and are employed worrying about things. While it's been proposed that we are more interesting than characters on television, one day soon we will be characters on television. The story is well told. The water tower can be taken up as a challenge to the mist. It invokes a center relative only to the imperceptible pattern I leave with my footsteps, mostly at night. Feeling like a mist, I look at things, trees. The water tower takes on sonnet form. In my dreams I embellish it with tacky Christmas decorations. I sit at the kitchen counter with the cat by my feet and watch the lights of the city in the distance and a skyscraper. Helicopters and planes revolve around it in peculiar orbit. Meanwhile, the book in my hands says we should try to hone our "sensation of <em>of</em>, <em>if</em>, <em>the</em>, and <em>some</em> as well as <em>tree</em>, <em>smoke</em>, <em>shed</em>, and <em>road</em>." I put the book on the counter and go into the yard. I do a little dance somewhere near the fence. I raise my arms above my head and swing my hips. I lower my arms and tap my feet on the grass. I do this for a while, and then I sit on cold lawn furniture, and then I finish cooking dinner. In this place, we eat chicken and peas at least once a week. Once a month we organize three weeks' worth of leftovers and once upon a time Mrs. Richardson introduced a new trend that was spatially&nbsp;interesting; it was intended to embellish our looks like poodle skirts or microwaves. We smoked clove cigarettes and stood in the Millers' backyard. I refer to these as "the early times." And other trends: we wrote poems. I wrote them with Lisle. I wrote her poems and she wrote mine. The subject matter was Egypt. We followed each other around town without looking, like tribal migrations. This was one whole epoch of my life. Later it seemed incomprehensible. Today Haywood uses language to articulate a room and I'm supposed to move inside it. I bump my hips against edges of tabletops, but I'm surprised to find each detail intact and some dramatically more effective than what preceded (two eggs on a white linen tablecloth). It's a kind of new Industrial Age and all our information is encoded or reproduced. I take three or four showers a day, but this would never make it into a biography of the town. What we want is a "true celebrity," an automatic pop star who can supervise the details of our lives. What we lack in inspiration we make up for in public charity, like the time we bought cowboy hats for the nameless kids who wander the town, or the time we all fainted at the murder of Sara Patterson. It's a whole universe of suggestion. There are all sorts of trends in the hedges (pornography, garbage, toxins, booze) and all over the countryside (atomized families, robots, childrearing, etc.). Mrs. Agnew is vilified for her intake of candy, the unfortunate part she plays in American culture, her redheaded remoteness. I stare at her front yard and try not to be there at all. So I close my eyes and become lightened and shadowed by clouds in the background and the&nbsp;foreground. There are dirty dishes in the sink and blooming roses on the countertop. On the table is a white tablecloth, a honeydew melon, two peaches, a paper napkin, two plates, two spoons, a lollipop. Also there is a ripeness, some strange flavor, erect and curious in my mouth. So I start on foot. For a while I pass nothing but the usual ribbon of lawn, then after a while I pass something else and a dog. Soon I pass Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Aubrey. I say, "This is a really nice lip balm." Then I say, "Set the table," then "Gems!" then "Nope." Later, I ignore myself on purpose, which takes practice. The book in my hands offers an analysis and sometimes a celebration; it says there is an "ascendancy of private, individualized transport." It's true we have ample parking and this is almost impossible to reverse. In the middle of the street are several small household appliances and a round yellow cake, which must have crossed into my path like a glass plate broken in a fit, or a healthy lawn, or a jar of grape jelly at the supermarket. All these things overlap and line up at the same time. I write letters on the white linen tablecloth and the dark blue ink enhances the effect of the cloth by providing stark contrast. Meanwhile, the crows in the yard act like dogs and Mrs. Wick leans over to tell me she's on a journey she likes to call "Mrs. Wick." This gossip involves listening and is for my own good. On the evening news there's a report about a national hero and a story on the two types of food: packaged and unpackaged. I learn there are many methods of preparation, such as freezing, freeze-drying, condensing, and dehydrating. I learn that last year a woman died from tuna fish, which doesn't require mixing or cooking so it's easy for you and your guests. The reporter says top chefs in major cities are using a new type of packaged food; they prepare the food themselves (liver, salmon, ribs, carrots), and seal it in plastic, and freeze it for up to eighteen months. One chef is interviewed. He says the whole world has been cooking the same way for over two hundred years and this has got to change. He shows his tongue to the camera to indicate playfulness and drops a lobster in boiling water. According to the reporter, this gourmet-packaged food can be served at four-star restaurants and to first-class passengers on airplanes and the armed forces defending liberty and freedom in all its forms. So I stand in front of the television holding the remote control. I aim it at myself for what must be twenty years. Then I turn south and take a long walk down sidewalks. There is a range of real activities in this place. One kid says, "Bring me an ice-cream cone," but sometimes you have to read between the lines. There are haircuts and play dates along with corporal punishment, orders, increased comforts, spinning, sleeping, eating, etc. There is love for people named Brittany and people named Jack, and most of us display some skill at pressing faces, or pressing people for information about what we like and what we find comfortable, or comforting. For example, we enjoy waterways, car races, immunizations, gymnastics, murals, hamburgers, flowering vines, babysitters, policies and programs, encircling verandas, skateboards, shrubs. Also, we like hoeing and bathing. When he returns from his job in the city, Haywood cleans his ears and asks for a drink. He sits by the fireside and talks to the television. He says, "I've been to the outskirts and back again several times." The arrival of cars was one particular epoch in this place. We bought cars whole families could fit in, cars with convertible tops, and tin trays for eating, and wonderful colors, and musical horns. Today we have cars with satellite mapping systems and anti-lock brakes. Also, we have latent perversions and other luxuries and good dinners and youth movements and next year we will not feel more or less crowded or more or less confined than we do tonight. Meanwhile, there is heavenly weather and a letter arrives. Among other things it eloquently and wittily hints at upcoming events. It's a very warm letter, ultra-comfortable. I spend the whole day sitting prominently on the porch, sunbathing in winterish sun, watching a massive and continuous flow of migrating birds. Large birds land on my lawn and flap their wings and shake. I associate myself strongly with them, with the way they put one foot in front of the other, and how they keep their heads aimed at the ground. They eat well. They have a huge and panoramic view of my house, yard, and automobile. We look across the wide green lawn and by the end of the day they've eaten several snails. I make two ribs of beef for dinner, one tuna, four omelets, one iced cucumber soup, two Chinese cabbages, two salads, five hams, one chicken liver, and for dessert I make pears in wine, one strawberry tart, one lemon tart, three apple pies, one bananas foster, and three chocolate cream pies. It's important to consider the effort it takes to survive. The world actually has signs with skulls and crossbones, vermin, separation anxiety, nightmares. But one highly respected tradition in this place is to get away from all that. The organization is based on the theme of American history and has fundamentally changed the feeling of this once-bucolic setting. Nevertheless, everything surprises me, everything I've forgotten, townsmen who belong to me and townsmen who do not, hula-hoops, garlic peelers, gulls, sunsets, swimming pools, asphalt, eggs, buttons on the stove, algae, credit cards, crops. I nod and return to my book: "Take any normal street of average length and just consider all that fucking!" Different views: we look at them sideways, up and down roads, transforming trees and boulders into eloquent mini-landscapes with subtle lighting and fountains. A kid on the street says, "Rocketry." Another kid says, "Oomph." Then one day there's a broccoli quiche on the edge of my dining room table. It's like a mysterious omen. I'm aroused and I almost lift it up and take it to myself like some seed I'd already planted, but instead I walk around it, all the way around, leaving a crescented track in the carpet with my spike-heeled shoes. Meanwhile, someone is shouting at someone else in Spanish, on the sidewalk, someone in a gray truck. I can't make it out. Dear Mrs. Baxter, Welcome. Your earnest and expensive skepticism is otherworldly. For this reason, I advise you to take two or three sheets of paper and make a journal of anything remarkable that occurs in the next few days. Idle romances, typographical reproductions, eye- and ear-witness testimony, the reality of our special community&#x2014;I recommend all these pleasures to you now. You'll need to keep track. You'll have to be strong, Mrs. Baxter. Everything is different, but over time, to a certain extent, nothing really happens. Such is the critical authenticity of every historical moment. Focus on apprehensible objects and their previously unapprehended relationships to other objects around your house or this place (your body to fish, glass to a quality of mind). It's a deal of fun. Yours, etc. &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Roast Figs Sugar Snow: Food to warm the soul</h2><p>An irresistible collection of enticing and memorable cold-weather food - updated with 6 completely new recipes.<br><br>Diana Henry spent 5 years travelling and eating in search of the tastiest dishes from the snowiest climes, resulting in an irresistible collection of dishes from North America and Northern Europe.

Now translated into English for the first time by one of the West's leading scholars of the I Ching, the Mawangdui Texts bring welcome clarity, accessibility, and novelty to this beloved classic. In addition, the Mawangdui version contains five new commentaries that had been lost for more than two thousand years, including the surprising discovery of a commentary that quotes Confucius extensively on how he had come to change his earlier, negative, views about the importance of the I Ching.<br><br>The lucid purity of this translation make this volume a work of timeless artistry, one that is surprising, illuminating, and welcome to even the most educated I Ching reader.</p><p>What are the most widely read and commented upon works in history? The Bible? The Vedas? The Quran? How about the <i>I Ching</i>? Every major thinker in Chinese history has had something to say about it. Passed down from generation to generation, it has been admired, studied, and put into practice. In 1973, archaeologists unearthed a number of silk manuscripts dating back to 168 B.C. Included in the find was a version of the <i>I Ching</i> and four commentaries previously lost. The text itself differed in places from the accepted version, especially in the arrangement of the hexagrams. Scholar Edward Shaughnessy has translated the entire text, along with the four commentaries and an additional commentary (the Appended Statements) that traditionally accompanies the text. The newly discovered commentaries offer a variety of interesting opinions, one of which appears to be Taoist, while another has Confucius explaining what the <i>I Ching</i> means to him. Shaughnessy includes the Chinese text of both the received version and the excavated version, although, unfortunately, the notes are buried in the back, making it difficult to follow the subtle differences. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Creative Watercolor: New Ways to Express Yourself</h2><p><b>The author of the award-winning <i>Easy Watercolor </i>is back, with a special instructional guide for intermediate painters.</b><br><br>Marcia Moses, whose award-winning<i> Easy Watercolor</i> taught beginners the basic skills of the art, now takes painters the next step in their creative journey.

Campbell is the lifetime president of the British Fantasy Society</p><p></p>While Liverpool is understandably best known for the Beatles, horror fans revere the British seaport as the hometown of Peter Atkins, Clive Barker, and, most prolific of them all, Ramsey Campbell. For his latest novel, Campbell explores some stranger features of Liverpool&#x2019;s background in a pleasurably unsettling fusion of fiction and history. Gavin Meadows gives eclectic and occasionally tiresome&#x2014;especially for disruptive American tourists&#x2014;guided excursions highlighting Liverpool&#x2019;s arcane, watery history. During a summer of heavy rains and a renaissance of city construction, Gavin&#x2019;s research into Liverpool&#x2019;s underground tunnels begins to reveal some surprising and unnerving information. An excavation for an office-building foundation, for instance, unearths coffins lined with lead, and postal workers become loath to use a tunnel linked to Lime Street Station. The most disturbing revelation, however, is that underground construction workers are hearing someone running ahead of them in the dark where no one or no thing should live.

Mike Dodge, with a wife, chose a more conventional path, while the single Kyle Swanson was swept up in special operations. Two years later, when Marine Corps Brigadier General Bradley Middleton was kidnapped by mercenaries and terrorists in Syria after the first Iraq War, Swanson went in and got him back but was mortally wounded in the fight, buried in Arlington, and posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. It was huge news throughout the nation and the Corps, and Mike and Becky mourned the loss of their friend. <br>However, things are not always as they seem, and three years later, Mike was shocked one evening to answer the front door of his two-bedroom home in Oceanside and find Kyle standing there, alive and well, beer in hand, ready to regale Becky with wild stories. It had all really been a major league Pentagon paperwork mistake, he said, and they couldn&#x2019;t very well take back the medal, nor unbury him. Instead, they had bounced him around on special assignments until someone could figure out an appropriate job for a dead guy. <br>The surprise reunion became a party that continued at a seafood restaurant on the Coast Highway just south of Del Mar. Back home about midnight, Kyle got down to the business part of his resurrection and the surprise visit. First, he swore them both to secrecy, making them put their hands on the family Bible. <br>&#x201c;Everything I told you earlier was bullshit,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but I had to see how you were both doing before I divulge the actual story. Tell no one what you are about to hear, not tomorrow or ever.&#x201d; <br>Swanson then confessed to Mike and Becky how he had been officially washed from the records to help create a totally black spec ops organization that was known as Task Force Trident. It was a handful of specialists who answered only to the president and was turning the War on Terror on its head by taking the fight right to the enemy&#x2019;s doorstep. Some really bad people had been learning there was no safe place to hide if they attacked America and its allies, and that there would be no martyrdom awaiting them, nothing but a bloody end. Trident could access any and all assets of the U.S. government to accomplish its missions; drones and SEALs and Delta Force and B-52s and computer geeks and federal agents and local cops and forensic psychologists could be called as needed for support. There were no paper trails to backtrack, and no punishment for carrying out the strikes, which were cleared personally by the president of the United States. <br>Kyle said that Trident had reached a stage where he really needed a partner he could trust out there in the boonies, and who was better at this game than Mike Dodge? Mike looked ready to sign up on the spot. Becky pulled back. <br>Think about it and talk it over, Swanson urged. Let me know tomorrow. Bumps could be expected in both pay grade and expenses. Big bumps, Kyle said. The Dodges talked all night before turning down the offer. It was the right move for them, Swanson admitted, but he at least had to try. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>INSTEAD OF RUNNING and gunning in dangerous special operations, at the end of another five years, in 2014, Gunnery Sergeant Mike Dodge found himself in command of the Marine security detachment at the U.S. Consulate in the peaceful diplomatic backwater of Barcelona, Spain. He wore a coat and tie to work, commuting from the two-bedroom apartment where he lived with Becky and their one-year-old son, Timmy. The place was all the way to the Reina Elsinda station, last stop on the Metro&#x2019;s L-6 line, and it was a quiet life, a good life for a man with both a sense of duty and a family. <br>On a bright Monday morning, when Dodge stepped from the train station, he immediately had a prickly feeling along his arms and neck that sent him into a state of alert. He saw nothing out of the ordinary, but the gunny had often felt that special tingling just before trouble broke out back during his combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. <br>At least on the surface, everything seemed fine. A line of Spanish locals and citizens of other nations wanting to obtain visas and process business permits had been forming for the past hour at the main gate to the consulate. All were orderly, standing there for a specific purpose, reading newspapers and drinking coffee. <br>Four Spanish cops were in front at the barrier that controlled vehicle entry. Dodge walked over to exchange greetings, and they confirmed that there was just the usual morning traffic and pedestrians. <br>Dodge walked into the consulate through the heavy main door, crossed the polished stone lobby floor, and was greeted by the day-shift guy, Corporal J. V. Harris, in uniform at Post One behind the bulletproof glass wall. Dodge eyeballed him to be sure he was squared away. J. V. stood six-two, with a square chin and broad shoulders, and was an imposing figure although he was only twenty years old. Buttons on the short-sleeve khaki shirt and the buckle of the white web belt were in exact alignment. A holstered pistol rode on the hip of his dress blue trousers, and the white cover was perched firmly on a high-and-tight haircut. &#x201c;Top of the morning, Gunny,&#x201d; Harris called out, buzzing him through the reinforced transparent entrance to the business area. &#x201c;Another excellent damned day in our beloved Marine Corps. Sergeant Martinez is in the back.&#x201d; Rico Martinez had been the night man and would be changing into his civvies to go home. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the threat assessment?&#x201d; Dodge asked. <br>&#x201c;Low. Martinez reports things were quiet all night. Nothing since I came aboard.&#x201d; <br>Dodge&#x2019;s eyes studied the young Marine. &#x201c;Are you sober?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course, Gunny.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And the guys at the House?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Absolutely. It was sort of a rough night in Barcelona, but if you want them, they can be on deck quick enough.&#x201d; <br>Dodge shook his head. That meant they were probably as hungover as sheets flapping on a clothesline. He couldn&#x2019;t shake the itchy warning feeling. &#x201c;Matter of fact, I do want them. Call over there and get them up. And you stay sharp.&#x201d; <br>The big door hissed closed and locked. Harris added, &#x201c;The RSO and the consul general are already back there.&#x201d; The RSO was the regional security officer for the Department of State&#x2019;s Diplomatic Security Service and technically in charge of overall consulate safety. <br>Dodge walked down the hallway, his eyes flicking to every door. Several consulate workers were at their computers at the front counter, getting ready to deal with the morning line. <i>I&#x2019;ll keep Martinez around for another hour,</i> he decided. <br>It was less than a minute before eight o&#x2019;clock when J. V. Harris picked up a secure telephone and dialed the House. The telephone rang once, twice, three times, but no one answered. He hung up, planning to wait a few minutes and give them one more try before reporting to the gunny, who would rip them all a new one if they didn&#x2019;t answer. Corporal Harris hung up and buzzed the security lock again, to allow a consulate worker with a big ring of keys to exit through the barrier so he could open the heavy, bulletproof main door. The business day was about to begin. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>THE MARINE HOUSE, a spacious Spanish-style structure of white stucco with a traditional red tile roof, was the official living quarters for five U.S. Marine Corps consulate guards in Barcelona. It was also a party place. When the large main room and manicured garden were not in use for diplomatic functions, it was one of the more popular nightlife addresses in the Sarri�/Sant Gervasi district. Off duty, the Marines knew how to have a good time. <br>Early on Monday morning, Sergeant John Dale was on his knees in the bathroom, paying due homage to the porcelain god after the latest Sunday night party. &#x201c;I think my brain is broken,&#x201d; he moaned, then his stomach seized and he retched again into the toilet. The feast of paella, roast pig, beer, and red Rioja wine had tasted much better going down than it did coming up. He flushed and slumped back against the chill finish of the tub, awaiting the next upheaval from his protesting stomach. <br>The two other Marines in the House were Sergeant Pete Palmer and Corporal Chet Morrison, both sleeping off their own hangovers. Palmer had a girl with him. The large house was laid out along a central hallway, with a big living room and dining area flanking the curved entrance alcove. Kitchen, bedrooms, and two full baths were lined down a central hallway that emptied into the manicured backyard, which had an enclosed swimming pool. It was the best place that the twenty-year-old Dale had ever lived, far beyond his dreams growing up in his small town in Indiana. A hell of a lot nicer than his last posting in Afghanistan. <br>A dry and aching spasm clutched his stomach and he barfed again, and this time knew he was finally empty. <i>There just can&#x2019;t be anything left down there.</i> Sick as a skunk with an exploding skull, but finally empty. Staring into the mirror as he washed his face and brushed his teeth, Dale promised to pace himself next time. Someday. Maybe. Wearing just his boxer shorts, he headed barefoot for the kitchen and a big glass of water while the coffee brewed. The living room was a wreck, but by noon the maid would clean it, the gardener would fix the flower beds, and the handyman would repair any damage, all on the government dime. <br>Dale drank deeply and looked out through one of the broad windows in the rear and saw the fresh April sun rising, with its orange light glistening along the thick border of juniper bushes and tall blue-green Spanish fir trees. Things were a mess out there, too. It was about eight o&#x2019;clock, but by evening it would all be squared away by the people who were paid to pick up after them and fix things. Like magic. This was his first embassy posting, and he liked the duty. <br>Had he been looking out of the front windows instead of the rear, Dale would have seen a small van coast to the curb, and five bearded men climb out and hurry through the front gate that opened without so much as a squeak. They all carried AK-47 submachine guns. With a low threat assessment throughout the area, all weapons in the Marine House were locked away in a safe. There was no local police security protection, for only an idiot would attack a group of Marines. <br>One of the men outside unspooled what looked like a long, narrow piece of weather stripping and snapped the prefabricated adhesive explosive around the edges of the heavy front door, then hustled for cover. A second one pressed the command detonator button, and a hard explosive charge smashed the quiet morning and blew the door to splinters. While the smoke was still thick, the five attackers rushed inside with their guns up and fingers on the triggers. <br>Sergeant John Dale was caught in the kitchen, where the blast of the door had left him sprawled on the floor beside the table, dazed and blinded by flying debris. The first burst of full-auto gunfire ripped his chest and stomach as the other gunmen hurried down the hallway, kicking in doors and shooting. Corporal Chet Morrison was leaping from his bed when he was knocked backward, stitched by a hail of AK-47 bullets. Sergeant Palmer and his girlfriend were still untangling themselves when a gunman stepped into the room and shot them both repeatedly. <br>The attack team, working from a map that had been carefully drawn by the maid, checked every room and closet, plus the garden and the tool shed, then hurried back to their car. As it sped away toward the harbor and a waiting fast boat to take them away from Spain, the Marine House telephone began to ring. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>FOUR HUMPBACKED Volkswagen Eurovans were parked bumper to bumper and with engines idling along the Carrer del Doctor Francesc Darder, less than three hundred yards south of the consulate. Each vehicle contained five men and an assortment of serious weapons. When the man in the passenger seat of the lead vehicle, a brown-eyed veteran fighter named Djahid Rebiane, received verbal confirmation that the Marine House raid was complete, he spoke one word softly to the driver, <i>&#x201c;V�monos.&#x201d; Let&#x2019;s go.</i> <br>They attacked just as the big front door of the consulate was swinging open. Gunmen in the lead car took out the Spanish police in the guard shack with quick bursts from automatic weapons; then Rebiane got out and lifted the boom-device barrier that blocked the road. The other four Eurovans sped through. Djahid Rebiane shouldered his AK-47 and walked calmly toward the consulate, opening fire on the startled civilians in the line outside. Three went down before they realized what was happening as panic grabbed the others. At the guardhouse, two terrorists established a defensive security position while two others began to assemble the tripod, tube, and aiming device of an 81 mm mortar. <br>The worker who had been opening the door saw the first shootings and moved to close it, but he was blown away by a pair of rocket-propelled grenades that demolished the entire entranceway. Almost simultaneously, another RPG team attacked the windows on the right side of the building, and the automatic weapons chattered in suppressing fire. <br>The three Marines inside the consulate, all battle-tested veterans, did not panic but moved with precision, although clearly on the defensive side of things. Gunny Dodge picked up an Uzi submachinegun. Martinez, wearing jeans and a blue T-shirt, came out of the back room fully armed and with a helmet and protective vest. Harris looked at the television monitors and saw civilians falling outside and a large attack team pressing in on all sides. <br>&#x201c;No response from the Marine House, Gunny,&#x201d; he shouted. <br>Dodge also looked at the monitors. &#x201c;We have to consider them dead. You guys hold in place while I get the RSO and consul general.&#x201d; Staff members were running down the central hallway to the safe rooms in the rear, putting Marine guns between themselves and the terrorists. Some of the secret squirrels began destroying sensitive equipment and shredding documents. <br>Dodge found the two State Department officials arguing. The RSO had his own weapon out and was telling Consul General Juanita Sandoval to get ready to move to an extraction point. She was refusing. Just then, the first mortar round hit the consulate roof and blew through the second floor, and the concussion knocked all of them to the carpet. <br>Up front, Harris and Martinez were hunkered into doorways as the first attackers charged into the destroyed lobby. Shooting would do no good because the thick glass that fronted the secure area was bulletproof on both sides. Djahid Rebiane knew that, and he brazenly strode through the lobby and slapped a small plastique charge against the inner door, then scrambled outside again. Martinez hollered a warning a split second before the detonation ripped the place apart. Harris loosed a volley into the opening, and then Martinez rolled into the hallway and opened fire, both ducking back to cover when a hand grenade came bouncing in. <br>Gunny Dodge and the RSO realized time was running out. The Spanish police would be on the way, but this was an orchestrated attack and would be over, one way or another, before any help could arrive. It was up to them to hold. The RSO ordered the consul general to get to the secure telephone in the safe room and call Washington immediately, but the woman hesitated. <br>&#x201c;Maybe they only want to take us prisoner,&#x201d; she said. She had been a political appointee to the unimportant position of consul general in Barcelona, and her job was mai...</p><h2>Ken Uston on Blackjack</h2><p>A legendary figure at the &#34;21&#34; tables in Nevada and Atlantic City casinos, Ken Uston and his &#34;team&#34; won more than $5,000,000.

He might have been a very versatile athlete if he hadn't quit sports at 11 for the guitar. Given his bent toward physical prowess, it isn't surprising that the best passages in his autobiography are about preparing to play, playing, and fishing. Driven by his lovingly disciplinarian father as well as love for the guitar, he became a professional soloist by his late teens. When his father comfortably retired at 47, Parkening decided to do the same at 30. Goal-driven to a fault, he succeeded. After a few years, however, he sold the dream ranch he'd bought, returned to Southern California, and resumed playing. Chastened by the emptiness of realizing his dream, he embraced Christianity with new understanding and purpose. He decided henceforth to play for God and share the gospel, and stories of how he has linked career and faith burgeon in the latter chapters of a book rewarding to music lovers, sport fishers, and believers alike. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this book Thomas Clark has painted a rich panorama of history and life along the river, peopled with the famous and infamous, ordinary folk and legendary characters. It is a canvas distinctly emblematic of the American experience. In the beginnings were occasional European explorers, John Swift&#39;s fabulous silver lode, and the lonely outpost of Boonesborough. As later romantic figures of the state, the mountaineer vied with the planter. The Kentucky belle Sally Ward is played against the fiery abolitionist Cassius Clay, the simple life of the Shakers against the blithe amusements of Graham&#39;s Springs. In these pages are mountain funerals and moonshining and the log runs that recaptured briefly the rowdy days of the earlier keelboat trade to New Orleans. And what account of Kentucky would be complete without notice of its contentious and confounding politics, its fleet horses, and its bountiful food? All these and more are portrayed here in Clark&#39;s fond yet shrewd story of the Kentucky River. The Kentucky was first published in 1942 in the &#34;Rivers of America&#34; series and has long been out of print. Reissued in this new enlarged edition for commemoration of the Commonwealth&#39;s bicentennial, it brings back to life a distinguished contribution to Kentuckiana and is itself a historical document of a past time.

Pushkin's life was a mixture of too much of pleasure or sorrow at any given time of his life. Henri Troyat has done an excellent job filling us in on how Pushkin's life was on a day to day basis. He has done it either by accounts of Pushkin's acquaintances' written records or sometimes his logical speculation. This is the second Russian Biography that I thoroughly enjoyed. First one was Robert Massie's "Peter the Great" Both Robert and Henri has done a very good job of bringing the Russian life of 17th and 18th century vividly in front of us which is very hard to do. I would suggest this book for anybody who is interested in Pushkin, I was drawn to this book because I was learning Pushkin's poems as part of my Russian class. So far I have learned Bronze horseman (Prologue), Winter evening, Winter morning and Ruslan &amp; Ludmila by heart and I can recite these in Russian fluently. So I thoroughly enjoyed the biography of one my favorite poets. I wish Henri has written similar book on Lermentov.</p><p></p><h2>Myths to Live by</h2><p>Joseph Campbell is a cultural hero finding inspirations in a wonderful mythical world. He creatively puts humanistic values and cosmic spiritual experience into the interpretation of contemporary science and art who has not only enriched research areas of mythology but also opened up the vast imagination space for human new mythology in the future. In &#34;&#34;Myths to Live By&#34;&#34;, he applies knowledge of literature, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, archeology and other science to the interpretation of myths, and makes an application of mythical thinking to the interpretation of human history, eastern and western civilizations, war and peace and many other problems commonly faced by human beings. He makes use of the only truth beyond a variety of illusions and conflicts in huamn society to penetrate the ancient and modern wisdom. He believes that the role of myths in the process of integration of individuals and society, society and nature, especially the process of returning to human inherence has been infinitely magnified. He tells people: the goal of life is to make the body pulsation fit with the universe pulsation, to make your own instincts fit with nature. &#34;&#34; Myths to Live By&#34;&#34; is a very important work of Joseph Campbell selected from his speeches in Cooper Union College Forum, which is a collection of important academic ideas in his life. He is affecting listeners with his language close to the public, special expression patterns and ebullient feelings. In his book, he not only analyzes impacts of science on the myth, discusses the development of human history and encounter and collision between eastern and western cultures, explores the returning journey of peoples hearts, but also guides people to know the nature, the earth and the universe outer space. Through this book, readers can experience great leaps of human spirit in history, and also make a deep exploration of mysteries from the outside world to the bottom of our hearts. As Campbell says: people will find the road walking for thousands of years, at this moment, people will receive an eternal life in myths and dreams.</p><p>Joseph Campbell was an American author and teacher best known for his work in the field of comparative mythology. He was born in New York City in 1904, and from early childhood he became interested in mythology. He loved to read books about American Indian cultures and frequently visited the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where he was fascinated by the museum&#x2019;s collection of totem poles. Campbell was educated at Columbia University, where he specialized in medieval literature, and, after earning a master&#x2019;s degree, continued his studies at universities in Paris and Munich. Throughout his life, he traveled extensively and wrote prolifically, authoring many books, including the four-volume series The Masks of God, Myths to Live By, The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, and A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake. Campbell died in 1987. In 1988, a series of television interviews with Bill Moyers, The Power of Myth, introduced his views to millions of people.</p><h2>Blood Never Lies</h2><p>The very essence of nutritional microscopy with never before seen clarity and conciseness.

Now he turns his attention to its increasing incidence in girls. Twenty-five years ago, ten boys were arrested for assault for every one girl. Now that ratio is four-to-one and dropping. Combining clinical experience with incisive analyses of social trends, Garbarino traces the factors&#x2014;many of them essentially positive&#x2014;behind the epidemic: girls&#x2019; increased participation in sports and greater comfort with their physicality, but also their lack of training in handling aggression. <i>See Jane Hit</i> goes beyond diagnosing the problem to outline a clear-eyed, compassionate solution.<br><br></p></p><p>James Garbarino, Ph.D., holds the Maude C. Clarke Chair in Humanistic Psychlogy at Loyola University Chicago, and from 1985 to 1994 he was president of the Erikson Institute for Advanced Study in Child Development. He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Garbarino has served as consultant or adviser to a wide range of organizations, including the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, the National Institute for Mental Health, the American Medical Association, the National Black Child Development Institute, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, and the FBI.Garbarino, a respected authority on juvenile violence and aggression (<i>Lost Boys</i>), takes a fascinating look at girls getting physical&#x2014;from the assertive physicality expressed by healthy girls to criminal violence on the part of troubled ones. He lauds girls' release from the obligation to be "ladylike" in an increasingly egalitarian society, a "new freedom... [that] can boost self-esteem and self-confidence." But at the other end of the spectrum are girls who are more vulnerable to today's increasingly "toxic social environment"&#x2014;a deleterious entanglement of hypersexuality and materialism&#x2014;and prone to asocial violence. Garbarino cites U.S. Justice Department statistics that the rate of girls arrested for assault is approaching that of boys. Examining biology, early childhood development and the effects of mass media, he builds on the work of other psychologists and social historians while adding texture to his accessible narrative with first-person accounts of girls' experiences&#x2014;X-rated name-calling, punching, brawls with baseball bats. Society, he asserts, should allow girls to be "physical and popular in a nonsexual and nonmaterialistic way." What girls need, he concludes in this evenhanded but eye-opening book, is positive identity, a sense of rootedness and spirituality, and benevolent adult involvement in their lives. <i>(On sale Feb. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It examines the arguments that divided George Orwell, future author of <em>Animal Farm </em>and <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, and Alex Comfort, poet, biologist, anarchist-pacifist, and future author of the international bestseller <em>The Joy of Sex&#x2014;</em>during WWII. Orwell maintained that standing aside, or opposing Britain&#x2019;s war against fascism, was &#x201c;objectively pro-fascist." Comfort argued that intellectuals who did not stand aside and denounce their own government&#x2019;s atrocities&#x2014;in Britain&#x2019;s case, saturation bombing of civilian population centers&#x2014;had &#x201c;sacrificed their responsible attitude to humanity.&#x201d;</p> <p>Later, Comfort and Orwell developed a friendship based on appreciation of each other&#x2019;s work and a common concern about the growing power and penetration of the State&#x2014;a concern that deeply influenced the writing of <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>. Shortly before his death in 1950, however, Orwell would accuse Comfort of being &#x201c;anti-British&#x201d; and &#x201c;temperamentally pro-totalitarian&#x201d; in a memo he prepared secretly for the Foreign Office&#x2014;a fact that Comfort, who died in 2000, never knew.</p> <p>Laursen&#x2019;s book<em> </em>takes a fresh look at the Orwell-Comfort quarrel and the lessons it holds for our very different world&#x2014;in which war has been replaced by undeclared &#x201c;conflicts,&#x201d; civilian bombing is even more enthusiastically practiced, and moral choices between two sides are rarely straightforward.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></p><p>Eric Laursen is an independent journalist, activist, and commentator.

A graduate of Columbia University, he lives in Buckland, Massachusetts.<b>The Duty to Stand Aside Nineteen Eighty-Four and the Wartime Quarrel of George Orwell and Alex Comfort</b><br> The summer of 1943 found George Orwell, English socialist man of letters, reaching the end of his patience with his job at the BBC. The cultural programs and commentary he'd been producing for the Indian and East Asian outposts of the British Empire were designed to counter German wartime radio transmissions. These broadcasts were not quite propaganda: he was allowed "reasonable freedom of speech" despite being (in his words) "an independent and more or less 'agin the government' commentator" and he could contribute to outside publications as well. But the job was boring. After two years at the network, Orwell, who had just turned 40, longed to go back to his own writing and journalism. <br> One of the poets whose work Orwell featured occasionally on his cultural programs was Alex Comfort, a talented 22-year-old who was taking medical training at the Royal London Hospital and beginning work as a research biologist. Neither man was spending World War II in the military. Orwell, who had been badly wounded while fighting in the Spanish Civil War and was showing signs of the tuberculosis that would ultimately kill him, was declared unfit for military service. Wishing passionately to contribute to this new war against fascism, he applied repeatedly to enlist but had to settle for a volunteer slot in Britain's civil defense force, the rag-tag, ill-equipped Home Guard. <br> There was never any question of Comfort serving in any capacity except as a medic or firewatcher during air raids: he was missing three and a half fingers of his left hand, the result of a botched attempt to make gunpowder for fireworks at age 14. But it's certain that he would not have enlisted even if he could. Comfort was a dedicated, outspoken anarchist and pacifist who charged at every possible opportunity that Britain's wartime leaders were ordering atrocities as bad as many of Hitler's, and that intellectuals who did not denounce their own government had "sacrificed their responsible attitude to humanity." He made it his business in particular to expose as war crimes the British and American air raids against German and occupied cities&#x2014;a campaign the allies' political leaders hailed as the key to victory and that was quite popular with the public to boot. <br> Not surprisingly, given their vastly different attitudes about the conflict, the two men attacked each other repeatedly in print. Orwell initiated the exchange with a review of Comfort?s first novel; it continued principally in the American magazine Partisan Review and the British social democratic newspaper <i>Tribune</i>?the latter in the form of an exchange of verse that summer of 1943 that became a minor classic of English polemic poetry?and in private conversation and correspondence. But their relationship was more complicated than this suggests. Simultaneously, they developed a cautious friendship based on Orwell's admiration for Comfort's poetry&#x2014;although his fiction, not so much&#x2014;and Comfort's respect for Orwell's incisive political commentary as well as his conduct as a Loyalist volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. <br> That friendship grew into an active collaboration when the government began prosecuting anarchists and antiwar activists toward the end of the war. It cooled when the Cold War again highlighted their ideological differences, but it endured, at least so far as Comfort knew, until just before Orwell's death in 1950. <br> By then, <i>Animal Farm</i> and <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> had been published and Orwell was on his way to becoming one of the most admired writers and moral voices of the postwar era?although from multiple, vastly different political perspectives. Comfort would become a well-known and controversial figure in Britain in 1961, when he and 31 other anti-nuclear activists were sentenced to a month in prison for organizing a mass sit-in in Trafalgar Square; in 1972 he would achieve worldwide bestsellerdom when his illustrated manual for couples, <i>The Joy of Sex</i>, was published. Comfort, who died a half-century after Orwell, always held a deep admiration for his onetime sparring partner, and although they only met in person once, regarded him as a friend. <br> Writing 30 years after Orwell?s passing, Comfort regretted the tone they had taken in their wartime quarrel. "We had publicly misrepresented one another," he wrote. "I probably mistook him for a hard-line Marxist, while he mistook me for another of [John] Middleton Murry's equivocal disciples," alluding to the poet and critic who had notoriously written that Hitler was "doing the dirty work of the Lord" and whose literary journal, the <i>Adelphi</i>, had helped launch both Orwell's and Comfort's literary careers. While they disagreed sharply about the morality of war, collaboration with the State, and later about the predicament that the Cold War created for artists and writers outside the Iron Curtain, Comfort believed he and Orwell were essentially on the same side: against authoritarianism and in favor of a society that relied more on cooperation and community than on capitalism and an overweening State. <br> For the most part, he was right. But in the 1990s it became known that in the last years of his life, as the Cold War was settling in, Orwell drew up a list of notable individuals he believed had pro-Soviet or not sufficiently anti-Soviet tendencies. He entrusted it to an employee of a propaganda branch of the Foreign Office. Included on the list were writers and economists, political activists and broadcasters, and celebrities like Charlie Chaplin and Michael Redgrave. <br> One of the names was that of Alex Comfort. "Is pacifist-anarchist," Orwell noted. "Main emphasis anti-British. Subjectively pro-German during war, appears temperamentally pro-totalitarian. Not morally courageous. Has a crippled hand.

At Glasgow University he majored in Irish history and wrote his Masters&#39;s thesis on his boyhood hero. This biography realises a longstanding ambition to do justice to one of the great figures of the century. Widely regarded as the world&#39;s greatest authority on the life and works of Robert Burns, Mackay&#39;s definitive biography, Burns, won the 1994 Saltire Society Book of the Year award. He is also the author of Vagabond of Verse: A Biography of Robert Service, Brave Heart: William Wallace, Allan Pinkerton: The Eye Who Never Slept and Sounds Out of Silence: A Life of Alexander Graham Bell.A stirring, comprehensive life of the great Irish patriot. ``If you think you understand what's going on, you're just confused,'' says a graffito current in Belfast. The same is true of Irish history, a sprawling mess of tangled loyalties and shifting allegiances. The life of Michael Collins (18901922) exemplifies the tortured, bloody course of modern Irish history. A kindhearted and warm man who in his heyday cheerfully ordered the assassination of political and military opponents, Collins rose to international prominence as a leader of the Irish independence movement. He had first emerged as a leader during the Easter uprising of 1916, in which hundreds of combatants and civilians died, and which Collins later rued as an enterprise ``that was bungled terribly, costing many a good life.'' Mackay (Burns: A Biography of Robert Burns, 1993) carefully describes Collins's contributions to the Irish armed resistance movement against British rule, first as a guerrilla, and later as commanding general of the national army. Mackay is also good, for the most part, in recounting and analyzing the complex negotiations with England that led to the founding of the Irish Free State after a costly, vicious civil war in which Collins fell victim to a sniper's bullet. Collins's story cannot be told independently of that of his principal opponent, Eamon de Valera, who remarked after Collins's death, ``In the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense.'' That much is true, but Mackay does not satisfactorily explore de Valera's character and motivations, and he remains a shadowy and somewhat sinister force. Neither does Mackay deal sufficiently with the charge of other historians that de Valera ordered Collins's assassination. He concludes, probably correctly, that the ambush in which Collins died was not intended specifically for him. Despite minor shortcomings, this is the best life of Collins now available, published just in time to coincide with Neil Jordan's film Michael Collins, with Liam Neeson in the lead role. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics&#x2014;one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents. Kant aspires to nothing less than this: to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us. In the text, Kant provides a groundbreaking argument that the rightness of an action is determined by the character of the principle that a person chooses to act upon. Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing. Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the categorical imperative, the concept that one must act only according to that precept which he or she would will to become a universal law. The Groundwork is broken into a preface, followed by three sections. Kant's argument works from common reason up to the supreme unconditional law, in order to identify its existence. He then works backwards from there to prove the relevance and weight of the moral law. The third and final section of the book is famously obscure, and it is partly because of this that Kant later, in 1788, decided to publish the Critique of Practical Reason.</p><p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was born in Konigsberg, Prussia, where he remained his entire life.

It was also a source of social and cultural change within England. Finding evidence of cultural exchange between England and the Caribbean as early as the seventeenth century, Susan Dwyer Amussen uncovers the learned practice of slaveholding.<br><br>As English colonists in the Caribbean quickly became large-scale slaveholders, they established new organizations of labor, new uses of authority, new laws, and new modes of violence, punishment, and repression in order to manage slaves. Concentrating on Barbados and Jamaica, England's two most important colonies, Amussen looks at cultural exports that affected the development of race, gender, labor, and class as categories of legal and social identity in England. Concepts of law and punishment in the Caribbean provided a model for expanded definitions of crime in England; the organization of sugar factories served as a model for early industrialization; and the construction of the "white woman" in the Caribbean contributed to changing notions of "ladyhood" in England. As Amussen demonstrates, the cultural changes necessary for settling the Caribbean became an important, though uncounted, colonial export.<br><br></p><p>"No scholar with the depth of Susan Dwyer Amussen's knowledge of seventeenth-century English society has ever considered the impact of Caribbean colonies and slavery on that society. England and its island colonies differed radically, but owning colonies and slaves changed the English not only in the islands but also at home in profound ways. Amussen has written a wide-ranging and fascinating account of that transformation."--Carla Gardina Pestana, Miami University <br>Susan Dwyer Amussen is professor of interdisciplinary studies at the Graduate College of the Union Institute and University.

That night D.W. worries that she will never be able to fall asleep again. Will blankie ever be found? Humorous illustrations and snappy dialogue capture this universal slice-of-life story that all blanket-carrying kids and their parents will recognize.</p><p>Marc Brown, who was born in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1946, received great encouragement and support from his grandmother and uncle. Inspired by the books of Maurice Sendak, Brown decided to pursue his ambition of becoming an illustrator. After receiving a B.F.A. in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art, he worked as a TV art director, a professor of mechanical drawing, and a freelance illustrator, before becoming a writer. In his books, he addresses the fears and problems which children face and events like friendship, family, school and pets. For his illustrations, Brown uses pencil with watercolor on a variety of papers to achieve different visual effects. The &#34;Arthur&#34; series, about the everyday adventures of a lovable aardvark, began in 1976 and continues to this day with 25 titles published. Brown has also created other series such as the &#34;Rhymes&#34; series, and the nonfiction &#34;Dinosaur&#34; series, which conveys messages of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. These series, like the stories of Arthur, hold the attention of young children while transporting their imaginations on magical journeys.PreSchool-KAAnother successful tale about D.W. and her brother, Arthur. This time the little aardvark has lost her beloved blanket and enlists her sibling's aid to find it. After a thorough search of the house with their father, they check the playground, the day-care center, the library, and even the car washAall places where preschoolers spend lots of time. Arthur, as usual, plays the "straight man" to D.W. The book has a wonderful story line, one that will be familiar to children and parents alike, and each page is filled with Brown's delightful renderings of a child's world. The vocabulary is simple enough for even a very young child to understand. For example, D.W. postulates that "the big vacuum thingie" at the car wash sucked her Blankie out the car window! Thankfully for D.W. (and for children everywhere who need a security blanket), Mother saves the day.

The great genius referred to it as his "greatest blunder," but recent events in the world of astrophysics have brought the prodigal term back into the fold as an important part of his field equation. Aczel is a powerful storyteller, and makes no secret of his admiration for Einstein; much of the book revolves around his conquest of general relativity. Integrating relativity with gravitation was no easy task (even for Einstein), but the author deftly steers the reader away from the sticky stuff and focuses attention on concepts of importance.<p> Aczel shows Einstein's aesthetic troubles with the cosmological constant, which preceded theoretical and experimental problems leading to its abandonment. The universe was caught in the act of expansion by Edwin Hubble, and the constant, originally invoked to maintain a steady-state universe, was unnecessary. Fortunately, though, the mathematics underlying the constant had become important tools for physicists; observations in 1997 and 1998 by Saul Perlmutter, Neta Bahcall, and others showed that the universe will continue expanding indefinitely and sent theorists back to the drawing board to revise their equations.

The whole church needs reassurance, especially in view of Marxist claims to be able by human effort to introduce a utopian world government. &#34;When the church lets part of its message go by default people look elsewhere for a substitute,&#34; writes Joyce Baldwin. &#34;All the more reason, then, why the church needs to be counting on the certainties proclaimed by Daniel, namely that God is constantly overruling and judging in the affairs of men, putting down the mighty from their seats, overthrowing unjust regimes and effectively bringing in His kingdom, which is to embrace all nations.&#34; The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series.</p><p>Joyce G. Baldwin (B.A., B.D.) was principal of Trinity College, Bristol, and wrote several volumes in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary series. She died in 1996."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

I did not possess a scriptural index to help them. Now, Professor Delamarter has offered us a monumental work, a valuable tool that helps us comprehend the meaning of a pseudepigraphon, and the ways a biblical book or passage has been interpreted in this vast corpus. We now have another key for perceiving how scripture was read, understood, and shaped by early Jews and Christians. A careful study of the citations themselves, and a precise retro version into Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek (which may not be difficult if the work is extant in those languages) will also guide us to a better understanding of the shape of a scriptural passage (conceivably not only its wording but even its orthography)."&#x2014;James H.

Searchers assume that the supposedly &#34;lost&#34; ten tribes of Israel would be found in isolated little bands of people. However, the first chapter of Hosea and other Biblical prophecies foretold that the nations of the ten tribes would be found among the most wealthy and powerful nations with large populations! This book identifies the modern house of Israel as those nations descending from the Goths, Saxons, Germans and related peoples who migrated into Europe from Asia after the fall of Parthia and Scythia. They have enjoyed national prominence, power, and prosperity as the primary recipients of the divine &#34;birthright&#34; blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant. Many nations have Israelite roots, in whole or in part. Not only did they retain Semitic-Israelite names and customs, but many of the tribal and clan names of the ten tribes of Israel are found among them. This book presents exciting new research and over 140 maps, charts, and illustrations to provide convincing evidence concerning the Israelite origin of large modern nations. The final portion of this book utilizes Biblical prophecies about the tribes of Israel, as well as evidence of secular history, to identify the descendants of each tribe in the modern world. Readers may marvel at how specifically the prophecies have been fulfilled among modern nations, and that these nations even now enjoy the promised blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant. With the substantial body of evidence laid out in this book, their Israelite origin and character is impossible to miss.</p><p></p><h2>A Perfect Score: The Art, Soul, and Business of a 21st-Century Winery</h2><p><b>A lively husband and wife team recounts their twenty-year climb from amateur winemakers to recipients of an almost unheard-of perfect score from Robert Parker's <i>Wine Advocate.</i></b><br>Kathryn and Craig Hall launched themselves head first into Napa Valley 20 years ago with the purchase of an 1885 winery and never looked back.

Although her principal concern is with the representation of fruit within literary texts and genres, she nevertheless grounds her analysis in the consideration of what actually happened in the gardens and orchards of the past.</p><p>As Bellamy progresses through sections devoted to specific literary genres, three central "characters" come to the fore: the apple, long a symbol of natural abundance, simplicity, and English integrity; the orange, associated with trade and exchange until its "naturalization" as a British resident; and the pineapple, often figured as a cossetted and exotic child of indulgence epitomizing extravagant luxury. She demonstrates how the portrayal of fruits within literary texts was complicated by symbolic associations derived from biblical and classical traditions, often identifying fruit with female temptation and sexual desire. Looking at seventeenth-century poetry, Restoration drama, eighteenth-century georgic, and the Romantic novel, as well as practical writings on fruit production and husbandry, Bellamy shows the ways in which the meanings and inflections that accumulated around different kinds of fruit related to contemporary concepts of gender, class, and race.</p><p>Examining the intersection of literary tradition and horticultural innovation, <i>The Language of Fruit</i> traces how writers from Andrew Marvell to Jane Austen responded to the challenges posed by the evolving social, economic, and symbolic functions of fruit over the long eighteenth century.</p></p><p>Liz Bellamy teaches English at City College Norwich and the Open University.<p>"Interweaving a bounty of historical details, in-depth literary readings, and engaging illustrations, Liz Bellamy tells a fascinating story about the evolution of raising, eating, thinking, and writing about fruit in the long eighteenth century."&#x2014;Rebecca Bushnell, University of Pennsylvania</p></p><h2>Beating Devils and Burning Their Books: Views of China, Japan, and the West (Asia Past &amp; Present)</h2><p>Beating Devils and Burning Their Books&#34; considers several topics germane to today&#39;s social and intellectual climate.

But if you want it to be, it can be more. ... At times it felt like the Parthenon had exploded around me and I had to wait for the dust and debris to settle to see clearly. But for me its success lies in providing a glimpse of that certainty which we all long for when faced with a period of great change and with a past we can no longer rely on to define the present.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>European Literature Network&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[A] slender but deeply charged novella concerning an unspeakable&#x2014;but sadly imaginable&#x2014;act of terrorism...One can read Ch.K. as a nihilistic heir of Albert Camus' antihero Meursault, or one can see in Chrissopoulos' plainspoken tale, told as a multipart procedural, an extended metaphor for the decline of Greece as a poor stepchild to the European Union, overrun by refugees and mired in apathy...Reminiscent of a half-century-old ancestor, Vassilis Vassilikos' 1966 novel Z, in its sardonic protest of things as they are." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews&nbsp;<br><br></i>"<i><i>The Parthenon Bomber</i><b>&nbsp;</b></i>is a slim volume that appealed to me initially due to its trim size and mustard-yellow cover. Published in Greek in 2010, it has now been brought out in English by Other Press, and its relevance hasn&#x2019;t dimmed. During World War II, an anarchist group (appropriately named the Harbingers of Chaos) called for the famed Parthenon to be razed. In 2004, a 21-year-old Athenian does just that, bombing the monument and inciting endless varieties of societal debate. Did the Parthenon matter? Does Greece matter? What does it mean to be the cradle of civilization in the wake of such an uncivilized act? The bomber&#x2019;s story is told through multiple voices, almost like&#x2014;wait for it&#x2014;a Greek chorus."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><i>Literary Hub&nbsp;</i><br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>The Parthenon Bomber </i>is a slim novella, presented essentially as a documentary work ...The first version of this novel was published in 1996, before terrorist acts on iconic structures such as those on the World Trade Centers in New York, or the willful destruction of classic structures such as that of the Bamiyan Buddhas or Palmyra. Awareness of these now colors the reading of the text...<i>The Parthenon Bomber</i> could be seen as almost teasingly understated; your average thriller writer would have built a much fatter book around such a sensational(istic) premise. But in leaving so much for the reader to fill in or consider, it's quite effective too -- intellectually teasing, in a positive sense...certainly intriguing, and quite nicely done.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Complete Review&nbsp;<br></i><br>&#x201c;What is the relationship between a city and those memorials which dominate the landscape?

Speak plainly and honestly, and be understood. Laura Wagner does just that in this brave, beautiful book, bringing us the complex life of Magdalie, and a glimpse of a people's soul." &#x2014;Jonathan M. Katz, author of<i> The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster<br> &nbsp;</i><br> "Haiti, already one of the poorest countries in the world, was devastated by the earthquake in 2010. This is a story of everything that comes after: from a candid depiction of the international response to a young girl&#x2019;s account of what a life of desperation can do to an individual and to a society. Magdalie&#x2019;s journey shows the importance of connections, of family and friends, during difficult times and the anguish that comes when those bonds are broken. In her debut novel, Laura Rose Wagner has managed to capture the devastation of loss while providing determined hope for the individual and the nation. An important read for anyone who wishes to better understand the reality of life in Haiti after the earthquake." &#x2014;Ophelia Dahl, executive director of Partners in Health<br> &nbsp;<br> Hold Tight, Don&#x2019;t Let Go follows the vivid story of two teenage cousins, raised as sisters, who survive the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. After losing the woman who raised them in the tragedy, Magdalie and Nadine must fend for themselves in the aftermath of the quake. The girls are inseparable, making the best of their new circumstances in a refugee camp with an affectionate, lively camaraderie, until Nadine, whose father lives in Miami, sends for her but not Magdalie. As she leaves, Nadine makes a promise she cannot keep: to bring Magdalie to Miami, too. Resourceful Magdalie focuses her efforts on a reunion with Nadine until she realizes her life is in Haiti, and that she must embrace its possibilities for love, friendship, and a future.</p><p>Laura Rose Wagner has a PhD in anthropology from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. She lived in Port-au-Prince from 2009 to 2012, and survived the earthquake. She travels to Haiti often, and founded a creative writing group for young people there.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;When a natural disaster strikes, what happens after the telethons, after the donations, and after the media attention has disappeared? This powerful debut novel follows Magdalie in the two years following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti as she grieves for her manman, adapts to life in the tent camps, and tries to find a place and a community that feels like home. Magdalie seeks to live a normal life in an impermanent society where "my memories are out to get me." People she loves appear and disappear, her home is made of plywood and plastic tarps, she ducks for cover at the slightest sound, and she has no hope of returning to school. She faces the tenuous circumstances with her beloved cousin Nadine, but then must brave them alone after Nadine is granted a U.S. visa. Wagner creates a portrait of post-earthquake Haiti that is a study of contrasts&#x2014;hopeful and bleak, warm and lonely. Magdalie searches for connections and solutions, but is also afraid of loving anybody when they might disappear at any moment. There have been literary works that highlight the devastation of the earthquake, but Hold Tight Don't Let Go is unique in that it highlights the two years after&#x2014;what international aid really looks like, how temporary situations become permanent, and the how profound losses affect those who are left. Wagner also effectively highlights the nuances of urban poverty and rural poverty. The book ends with a sweet, optimistic epilogue that provides happy endings, but detracts from the power of the novel. Wagner provides a helpful glossary and brief history of Haiti.

(v.8)<br> For reading &amp; meditation &#x2013; Ezekiel 47:1&#x2013;12 </p><p>Our subject is a challenging but deeply inspiring one &#x2013; Staying Spiritually Fresh. The idea for this theme arose out of a letter I received some time ago which said: "Over the past year or so, my Christian life has become stale &#x2013; insufferably so. I have lost the freshness and spontaneity I once knew. Can you say something that will help bring back the sparkle into my Christian experience? What is the remedy?" </p><p>I want to introduce you to twelve principles which, when put into practice, will enable you to maintain spiritual freshness even though around you all may be stale and arid. They have worked for me for over forty years &#x2013; I believe they will also work for you. But can we expect always to live in a state of spiritual alertness and freshness? Isn&#x2019;t that being unrealistically optimistic? Well, what does Scripture say? It shows that the people of God are meant to be beautiful gardens in the midst of a dry desert. The prophet Isaiah puts it like this: "And you shall be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not" (Isa. 58:11, Amplified Bible). </p><p>In our text for today, Ezekiel speaks of the river flowing "into the Dead Sea, into the brackish waters which shall turn fresh" (Moffatt). How thrilling. The river of God flowing into our dead seas turns them fresh. Whatever reasons there are for our lives becoming spiritually stale, it is quite clear from Scripture that they need not be so. God offers to exchange His strength daily for our weakness, His freshness for our staleness. Let&#x2019;s go for it. </p><p>Prayer </p><p>My Father and my God, I come at the beginning of these meditations to ask that You will make my life like a watered garden. Let Your fresh rivers run into my dead seas so that my whole being is revived &#x2013; day after day after day. Amen.</p></p><h2>God&#39;s Masterwork: A Concerto in Sixty-Six Movements : Ezra Through Daniel (Swindoll Bible Study Guides , Part 2)</h2><p><p>From the leadership of Ezra through the integrity of Daniel, see God's faithfulness and love to Israel during its obedience, rebellion, and restoration.

The quonset hut, that sliced tube of corrugated metal, was the answer. Over a hundred thousand were produced as part of the war effort. In its aftermath, even more were built and existing huts were adapted to house the postwar population boom. Of course, it couldn't last: the American desire for permanence meant decay and neglect for many of these rough-and-ready shelters and quickie warehouses. <p>But in the midst of its almost tragic tale of extinction, the quonset hut has emerged as an unexpected icon of Americana and an oasis of architectural imagination. Travel the back roads of America and you will find the quonset's distinctive shape enclosing everything from houses of worship to houses of pancakes. </p><p> <i>Quonset Hut</i> tells the story of this unique architectural phenomena, from its birth during WWII as a mass-production shelter to its new status as an icon of American pragmatism, ingenuity, perseverance, and individuality.</p></p><p>Chris Chiei is project director for the national research project Quonset.

The Turkish author relates the day-to-day experiences of the women who inhabited these chambers: what they ate, wore, the games they played together, the opium-induced reveries in which they passed long hours. Croutier also considers the harem in larger contexts: as the "unbelievably repressive" Moslem equivalent of purdah; as "a unique archetype of the collective unconscious--matriarchy incubating in the cradle of patriarchy." But "harem" is Turkish for "forbidden, protected," and the Grand Harem guarded its secrets from the world successfully. Partly because Croutier doesn't always evoke harem life well in her own words, we wish for--but don't hear--the voices of the women themselves. Ultimately, the text is a choppy amalgam of history, reminiscence, conjecture and intermittently overblown writing ("The walls seemed to whisper secrets pleading to be heard"). Much more evocative are the 125 photographs and reproductions of art works included here.

Now imagine having it all for yourself whenever you want it! The Ultimate Cheesecake Cookbook makes homemade cheesecake so incredibly easy and fun, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more perfect dessert for every occasion. Famed radio personality Joey Reynolds and the queen of cheesecakes herself, Myra "Mother Wonderful" Chanin, have created lighthearted and simple-to-follow recipes for dozens of delicious cheesecakes--some fancy enough for your most formal dinner parties, some so easy they're practically instant--in lucsious flavors like Butter Nut, Apricot Almond, Strawberry Rhubarb, Chocolate Mint, Jomocha, and Ginger Pear. Joey and Myra also teach you how to make cheesecake muffing and cookies, as well as no-bake cheesecakes for those hot summer days, and they supply the key to creating your own custom cheesecake flavors.<br></p><p>If your ultimate cheesecake is rich and creamy, heavy with cream cheese, and best eaten in slivers, look no further. Joey Reynolds, syndicated talk-show host, and Myra Chanin, cookbook author and food writer, have teamed up to deliver the mother lode of cheesecake recipes. Although there are dozens and dozens of recipes in this book, they are all variations of two basic ones--baked and nonbaked. <p> With flavors as interesting as Cranberry Mint Cheesecake, Apricot Streusel Cheesecake, White Cassis Cheesecake, and Honey Fig Cheesecake, you'll use this book as much for ideas as you will for the recipes. Reynolds and Chanin love flavorings and extracts, and they begin by recommending their favorite producers and then use almost every flavor made by them. With the "Bonus" Magic Formula Which Will Allow You to Experiment and Concoct Your Own Personally Flavored Baked Cheesecake, you can add any of the flavors they haven't already, and you'll never have to make the same flavor twice. Reynolds and Chanin are imaginative and are sure to get your creative juices flowing with decadences such as Southern Peach Cheesecake, made with peach extract and preserves, coconut flakes, and chopped pecans, and crowd-pleasers such as Jamoca Cheesecake, made with instant espresso, coffee-flavored liqueur, chocolate, and walnuts. These are not the flat-topped, custardlike cheesecakes that belong on fine-dining dessert carts, but rather the rich, dense, lightly browned New York-style cheesecakes that gave the dessert its American-icon status. Don't worry about the cracks, Reynolds and Chanin reassure us--the baked sour-cream topping is the perfect foil. With 23 tips to encourage us, such as Think Positive, Use Plastic-Wrap Mittens to Press Down the Crumb-Crust Mix Around the Pan, and Never Bake Cheesecakes at the Last Minute, novice bakers should feel confident and will be amused by the authors' lighthearted tones.</p><p> The second master recipe is The Magic Formula Which Will Allow You to Experiment and Concoct Your Own Personally Flavored Nonbaked Cheesecake. It comes at the end of a chapter of recipes for nonbaked cheesecakes such as Holiday Ginger Pumpkin Cheesecake, Banana-Split Cheesecake, and Caramel Nut Cheesecake. These nonbaked cheesecakes call for sweetened condensed milk and an acidic fruit juice, which makes them to set up the way Key Lime Pie is set. They also contain a "fruit protector" (ascorbic acid and corn sugar) called Fruit Fresh. </p><p> The final section of the book is "Other People's Cheesecakes," and it serves to remind us that even if you already have our own favorite cheesecake recipes and techniques, you can never have too many. <i>--Leora Y.

She has retinitis pigmentosa, what she calls RP. Like, I&#x2019;m so sick of this stupid RP. Which makes the disease sound like one of those jerks she goes to middle school with &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;the BGs and BJs and RJs &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;who talk too loudly and wear chunky basketball shoes and toss French fries dipped in mustard across the cafeteria and draw dicks on people&#x2019;s lockers with permanent marker. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was diagnosed at five. She&#x2019;s twelve now. But she acts like she&#x2019;s forty. That&#x2019;s what everyone tells her. &#x201c;An old soul,&#x201d; her mother says. &#x201c;Stick in the mud,&#x201d; her aunt Lela says. If she had a smartphone, if she had boyfriends, if she hung out at Starbucks and Clackamas Center Mall, if she didn&#x2019;t rely on her mother&#x2019;s help to pick out her clothes, if she didn&#x2019;t prod the sidewalk with a stupid cane or wear stupid sunglasses to hide her stupid absent eyes, if she could see, maybe then she wouldn&#x2019;t be such a boring grump, maybe then she would act more like the rest of the giggling, perfume-bombed lunatics her age. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first she couldn&#x2019;t see at night, crashing into walls on the way to the bathroom. Then her sight fogged over. Then her peripheral vision began to decrease, like two doors closing slowly, slowly, over several years, until there was only a line of vertical light with color-blurred shapes passing through it. If she held something directly in front of her face, she could get a pretty good sense of it, but one day, within the next five years or so, darkness will come. She&#x2019;ll live in a permanent night. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hers was an accelerated case. And there was no cure. That was what the doctors said. So her mother prayed. And gave Hannah vitamins A and E. And restricted her intake of phytanic acids, so no dairy, no seafood. Hannah tried a dog, but she was allergic and got sick of cleaning up his crap. And she visited a school for the blind, but that felt like giving up, despite the crush of bodies at her middle school, the eyes she could feel crawling all over her while the occasional BG or BJ or RJ whispered a Helen Keller joke. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a doctor at OHSU approached her about an experimental trial. Would she be interested? She knew all about gene therapy and about the retinal transplants that had so far failed to develop synaptic connections with their hosts, but she didn&#x2019;t know about this, a prosthesis built by a Seattle-based tech company. It converted video images captured by a camera into electrical pulses that bypassed the diseased outer retina and poured into over one thousand electrodes on the inner retina. They called it Mirage. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all very <i>Star Trek</i>,&#x201d; the doctor told her, when describing the device, not glasses so much as a silver shield that wrapped your eyes. She liked his Indian accent, the buoyancy of the vowels, making his words sound as if they were gently bouncing. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother worried that people would stare, and Hannah said, &#x201c;They already stare.&#x201d; At least they&#x2019;d be studying her now with awe and curiosity rather than pity. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be a cyborg, a Terminator!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother could never afford the surgery &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;the removal of the post subcapsular cataracts and spoke-wheel pattern of cysts, the insertion of the casing and array and antennae along the periphery of her sockets &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;which didn&#x2019;t matter: the tech company would pay for everything, so long as she agreed to serve as their lab rat and advertisement. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, three weeks after she went under the knife, it is time to take off the bandages. Now it is time to wire up the Mirage. To see. The doctor tells her it might take time for her brain to process this new sensory experience. &#x201c;Think of it like this. What if I gave you a new set of lungs that allowed you to breathe underwater? The first time you jumped in the river and took a deep breath, your body would fight the feeling, thinking you were drowning. There will be a little bit of that at first. A little bit of drowning. But I believe it will pass quickly.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hannah knows the sun is a yellow ball of fire &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;she can still see the smear of it &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;but the image has been replaced more by a feeling of warmth that tingles the hair on her arms and makes her turn her face toward the source. Yes, a pine tree has a reddish trunk and green needles and cuts away the sky when you stand beneath it, but for her the sensory analogue is the smell of resin and the feel of scabby bark plates beneath her palm and the sound of the hushing, prickling breeze when it rushes through the branches. The ability to see has become an abstraction, something she can only vaguely imagine, like time travel or teleportation. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sits on an exam table with the doctor leaning in and her mother hovering nearby. He tries to make small talk &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;asking how&#x2019;s school, is she excited, will she do anything to celebrate &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;but she can barely manage a response, all of her attention on the tug of his hands, the wounded ache of her eyes. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t go out to restaurants very much, but we&#x2019;re going to one tomorrow,&#x201d; her mother says. &#x201c;Benedikt&#x2019;s. For lunch. To celebrate. With my sister. She writes for the paper. Maybe you&#x2019;ve read her articles? She writes about other people&#x2019;s problems, but let me tell you, she has plenty of her own. Anyway, as long as Hannah is feeling up for it, that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re planning.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; the doctor says. &#x201c;Almost done.&#x201d; Then the last bit of bandage pulls away and he says, &#x201c;There.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A part of Hannah feels lighter, more buoyant, now that she&#x2019;s unrestricted by all that gauze and tape, but another part of her feels more panicked than ever &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;as if, when he said, &#x201c;There,&#x201d; a light switch should have turned on in her head. For now there is only darkness. Her brain churns. She can taste her breakfast in her throat. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leans in and thumbs aside her lids and shines a light on the still-sore incisions and nudges the outlet. &#x201c;Good, good. Okay. I think we&#x2019;re ready for Mirage.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hannah has worn it before, more than a month ago. She ran her fingers along the shape of it then, the sleek silver shield that wrapped her eyes. But that was just playing pretend. This is real. The doctor fits it into place, tightening the band around the back of her head and neatening her hair. Two bulges, almost like the nubs of horns, swell next to each of her temples. These are the brains of the thing, a cluster of microprocessors. The right one carries the small power switch. The doctor asks if she&#x2019;d like to do the honors. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She nods and blows out a steadying breath and snaps the switch. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; the doctor says. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hannah?&#x201d; her mother says. &#x201c;Did it work? Is it working?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a game she sometimes plays. The wishing game. She&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to our trip to Costa Rica,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m riding a horse across the Scottish Highlands,&#x201d; and then, as if a spell has been cast, an image will crystallize. She is on a white sand beach with coconuts thudding the sand and dolphins arcing from a lagoon. She is pounding across a bog, through swirling mists, while the horse kicks up divots of mud and bagpipes honk and wheeze. No matter how expensive or distant or impossible the dream, the wishing game makes anything possible. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can see,&#x201d; she says. She has said this many times before, has whispered it into her pillow and coat collar and closet, testing the words in quiet places to see if they spoil once released to the air. But this time it&#x2019;s true. She can see. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult for her to comprehend images, her frame of reference so far limited to her other senses. What she sees is like an echo. And inside the echo there is another voice. There is a blazing white above, and a muted white all around, through which things &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;people? &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;move. Her mother asks, &#x201c;Can you see me? Hannah?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sees something, but is it her mother? It must be. But everything is mixed up. She can&#x2019;t forge colors with shapes or shapes with distance or distance with texture, every different input temporarily fizzling her brain, making her want to shout, &#x201c;Does not compute, does not compute!&#x201d; As if someone put a banana under her nose and a shark in front of her face and jazz in her ear and a broom in her hand and said, &#x201c;What a beautiful sunset.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell what&#x2019;s real.&#x201d;</p><h2>Little Golden Book Classics Three Best-Loved Tales</h2><p>This is a collection of three stories retelling some favorite fairy tales: Mister Dog, The Color Kittens &amp; Seven Little Postmen.</p><p></p><h2>Studies in Matthew</h2><p>Translated by Rosemary Selle<br><br>The work of one of the world's foremost New Testament scholars, Ulrich Luz, this book gathers eighteen penetrating studies of Matthew's Gospel, available here in English for the first time.<br><br>Luz's groundbreaking work ranges widely over the critical issues of Matthean studies, including the narrative structure and sources of the Gospel and its presentation of such themes as christology, discipleship, miracles, and Israel. Several chapters also outline and demonstrate the hermeneutical methods underlying Luz's acclaimed commentary on Matthew, for which this book can serve as a companion.

Moving constantly across national borders they can be found in the present-day nations of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya. For much of their history, they controlled the lucrative caravan trading routes that linked the African interior with the markets of Europe and the rest of the world, but as colonialism upended power relationships throughout the region in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their role&#x2014;and their world&#x2014;changed dramatically.<br><br>Yet as this visually stunning volume demonstrates, the Tuareg survived, and even retained their unique culture, language, traditions, and social structures.

The seventh novel in Kennedy's Albany series, <i>Roscoe</i> follows Roscoe Conway, a quick-witted, charismatic lawyer-politician who has devoted much of his life to helping his Democratic Party cohorts achieve and maintain political power in 1930s and &#x2018;40s Albany, New York. It's 1945, and Roscoe has decided to retire from politics, but a series of deaths and scandals forces him to stay and confront his past. Kennedy takes the reader on an intricate, whirlwind tour of (mostly) fictional Albany in the first half of the 20th century. He presents a mythologized, tabloid version of history, leaving no stone unturned: a multitude of gangsters, bookies, thieves, and hookers mingle with politicians, cops, and lawyers. In the middle of it all is Roscoe, the kind of behind-the-scenes, wisecracking, truth-bending man of the people who makes everything happen--or at least it's fun to think so. Kennedy shows an obvious affection for his book's colorful characters and historic Albany, and he describes both with loving specificity. Though the book often works as light comedy, its clich�d plot developments and stereotypical characters undermine its serious concerns with truth, history, and honor. "You've never met a politician like Roscoe Conway," promises the book's jacket blurb. But we have, through his different roles in countless films and TV series. As with its notoriously deceitful hero, <i>Roscoe</i> is likeable as long as you don't take it too seriously. <i>--Ross Doll</i><b>William Kennedy</b>, author, screenwriter and playwright, was born and raised in Albany, New York.

Lee</h2><p>Perhaps no other American historical figure is as shrouded in legend as General Robert E. Lee. Long extolled as the perfect gentleman as well as the consummate military commander, Lee&#x2014;known as the Marble Man&#x2014;has been venerated more than understood. During his lifetime, he contributed to this picture through the austerity and rigid control he tried to impose on himself.<br><br>The Making of Robert E. Lee reveals the flesh-and-blood Lee&#x2014;not to expose him but to better understand a man who was perhaps the most fervent practitioner of the Southern code of conduct, behind which he camouflaged much of his character.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>With unprecedented insight into Robert E. Lee's personal and public lives, Michael Fellman humanizes this one-dimensional icon, placing him within history rather than above it. With both detachment and compassion, Fellman deftly probes beneath the surface to show Lee as a deeply conflicted man, one with sometimes surprising views on sexuality, family, religion, and politics, as well as military practice. This realistic portrayal situates Lee firmly in the contexts of his time, place, class, gender, and race.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Although Lee tried to be a virtuous, even perfect man, he often flirted extravagantly&#x2014;and perhaps did more&#x2014;with women other than his wife. While he strove to be a kind and honest leader, he was extremely distant from and controlling of both his sons and the soldiers in his Civil War army. With his deeply ingrained habits of command, Lee the aristocratic disciplinarian looked down upon the white lower orders as he did upon slaves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>After a distinguished if conventional career in the peacetime American army, Lee chose to join the Confederate cause on account of his unquestioning identification with the values and interests of the Virginia slaveholding class. Something of a failure during the first year of combat, Lee was thrust into command at a crucial juncture in the war, just as the Union army approached Richmond, the Confederate capital. Fellman argues that "the Civil War rescued Robert E. Lee from marginality and obscurity."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>No general proved more audacious and tenacious than Lee, and none had a greater passion for battle. For a year, almost without exception, an increasingly confident Lee guided a seemingly invincible army, winning great victories at high costs. Finally overreaching the capabilities of his troops, Lee led them into crushing defeat at Gettysburg, after which his customary humility returned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Paradoxically, even though war ultimately reinforced Lee's deep pessimism in the face of Fate, afterward he became a conscious inspiration and adviser to elite whites who sought to destroy Reconstruction and keep blacks at the bottom of the social order. he became a spokesman as well as a rallying point for those postwar Southern nationalists who sought, with success, to maintain and strengthen white supremacy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Fellman's study does far more than any previous book both to uncover the intelligent, ambitious, and often troubled man behind the legend and to explore his life within the social, cultural, and political contexts of the mid-nineteenth-century South.<br><br></p><p>Civil War scholar Michael Fellman investigates the psychology and beliefs of that conflict's most admired general in an intriguing intellectual biography. From his days as a cadet at West Point, Robert E. Lee (1807-70) struck his companions and teachers as "a full-blown aristocratic beau ideal ... tall, stunningly handsome, bright, manly, commanding." His brilliant leadership of the Confederate army against daunting odds only increased Southerners' reverence, which came to be shared by many white Northerners after the partisan passions of the war had faded. Fellman probes behind the fa�ade of the "Marble Man" to discover the conflicts and uncertainties that seethed there. Son of an American Revolutionary legend who ended his life in bankruptcy and disgrace, Lee felt that he must redeem his family name and become the perfect Southern gentleman; yet, he struggled to reconcile his ideals of Christian virtue, self-denial, humility, duty, and honor with his desire for fame and success. "In a very real sense," Fellman writes, "the Civil War rescued Robert E. Lee from marginality and obscurity. In it, he learned to focus his values, his talent, and his deepest feelings on the terrible martial problems at hand." Exploring those values, Fellman unsparingly reveals their roots in racism, repression, and hypocrisy; yet, he acknowledges and admires (with reservations) Lee's sincere adherence to them. "He walked not above but within all the contradictions of a specific society," Fellman writes. "This makes him far more interesting than some boring marble representation of the supposedly unitary and perfect saint." Some ardent worshippers of "Saint Robert" might disagree, but most students of American history will find this a stimulating reassessment. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Praise for Michael Fellman's Citizen Sherman<br>"This superb biography gives as full a portrait of<br>nineteenth-century family dynamics as of the dynamics of the battlefield."<br>--The New Yorker<br><br>"Gripping and original, this is the definitive modern study of<br>the Civil War's most feared fighter."<p><br>--Chicago Tribune<br><br>"A penetrating study of one of the most enigmatic and<br>controversial figures in American history."<br>--The Boston Globe<br><br>"Boldly argued and gracefully written."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A vivid portrait of perhaps the most savage warrior of the Civil War period."<br>--The Wall Street Journal<br><br>"A fascinating and readable book about a famous and<br>furious man, brilliant, insightful, garrulous, complicated, tightly wound,<br>energetic, aggressive, salty, angry, and racist.

She was known as the Queen of Fashion; a headline attraction in the international glitter-glamour show of the late twenties and thirties, feted in Rome (where she was born), Paris, New York, London, Moscow, Hollywood . . .<br><br>Her style was a social revolution through clothing&#x2014;luxurious, eccentric, ironic, sexy<i>.</i> Her fashions, inspired, from the whimsical to the most practical&#x2014;from a Venetian cape of the <i>commedia dell&#x2019;arte </i>to the Soviet parachute. She collaborated with some of the greatest artists of the twentieth century: on jewelry designs with Jean Schlumberger; on clothes with Salvador Dal� (his lobster dress for her, a lobster garnished with parsley painted on the skirt of an organdy dress, was instantly bought by Wallis Simpson for her honeymoon with the Duke of Windsor); with Jean Cocteau, Alberto Giacometti, Christian B�rard, photographers Baron Adolph de Meyer, Horst, Cecil Beaton, and the young Richard Avedon. <br><br>She was the first designer to use rayon and latex, thick velvets, transparent and waterproof, and cellophane. Her perfume&#x2014;Shocking!&#x2014;was a bottle in the shape of a bust sculpted by L�onor Fini, inspired by the body of Mae West. Her boutique at an eighteenth-century palace at 21 Place Vend�me opened into a cage designed by Jean-Michel Frank. American <i>Vogue</i>, in 1927, presented her entire collection as Works of Art. A decade later, she was the first European to win the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award.<br> Here is the never-before-told story of this most extraordinary fashion designer, perhaps <i>the</i> most extraordinary fashion designer of the twentieth century, in her day more famous than Chanel. Meryle Secrest, acclaimed biographer, who has captured the lives of many of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most iconic cultural figures, among them: Frank Lloyd Wright, Bernard Berenson, and Modigliani, gives us the first full life of the grand couturier&#x2014;surrealist and embattled figure&#x2013;-whose medium was apparel.<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dare to be different,&#x201d; Schiaparelli advised women, and she lived it to the height; a rebel against convention&#x2014;social as well as fashion. She designed an otter-fur bathing suit and a hat inspired by a lamb chop. (&#x201c;I like to amuse myself,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If I didn&#x2019;t, I would die.&#x201d;) Chanel, her arch rival, called her, &#x201c;that Italian woman who makes dresses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Here is the story of Schiaparelli&#x2019;s rise to fame (as brazen and unique as any of the artistic creations that emerged from her Paris workrooms before World War II); her emotionally starved upbringing in Rome (her mother was part Scottish, part Neapolitan; her father, a prominent medieval&nbsp; scholar specializing in Islamic manuscripts, dean of the faculty of Rome; her uncle, an astronomer famous for his description in 1877 of &#x201c;canals&#x201d; on Mars); her years overshadowed by a prettier sister; her &nbsp;elopement with a Swiss-born man who claimed to be a count, disciple of mysticism and the occult&#x2014;who managed to get himself and his young bride deported from Britain . . . her struggle to care for her polio-stricken daughter, Gogo, as a single and financially destitute mother living in Greenwich Village. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Secrest writes of Schiaparelli&#x2019;s keen instincts&#x2014;an astute businesswoman, she launched herself into hats, hose, soaps, shoes, handbags, in the space of a few years. By 1930, her company was grossing millions of francs a year.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Secrest chronicles her exploits during World War II (she managed to escape from Europe to the United States) and, using FBI files, shows that during Schiaparelli&#x2019;s stay in New York, her whereabouts were documented almost week by week; she was never explicitly charged, but the cloud of collaboration lingered long after her return to Paris.<br><br>As Secrest traces the unfolding of this dazzling career, she reveals the spirit that gave shape to this large and extravagant life, a woman&#x2014;a force&#x2014;whose artistic vision forever changed the face of fashion and redefined the boundaries of art.</p><p>Meryle Secrest was born and educated in Bath, England, and lives in Washington, D.C. She is the author of eleven biographies and was awarded the 2006 Presidential National Humanities Medal.The most extraordinary fashion designer of the twentieth century is now just a name on a perfume bottle. She is Elsa Schiaparelli, like Gabrielle Chanel a successful woman in the hierarchy of male Paris couturiers. But she was much more than a dress designer. Schiaparelli was an integral part of the whole artistic movement of the times. Her groundbreaking collaborations with such artists as Kees van Dongen, Salvador Dal�, Christian B�rard, Jean Cocteau, Alberto Giacometti, and Man Ray took the field of women&#x2019;s wear from a business into an art form.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the years between World Wars I and II, Schiaparelli, like Chanel, created clothes that were attuned to new freedoms for women and the reality of the role they were playing in the workplace. Skirts left the ankle and stayed close to the knee. Crippling corsets disappeared. Silhouettes were practical and wearable; fabrics could be washed. She was as much inventor as designer of style. Realizing that putting on a dress over the head could be a nuisance, she came up with a dress that could be wrapped around the body, an idea that is still with us. Split skirts were practical; she would show them even though it took decades for the idea of wide-legged pants to be socially acceptable, and even longer for the pantsuit. She patented swimsuits with built-in bras and went on to design similar shortcuts for dresses. The zipper arrived and she used it with panache. The Depression arrived, and along with it the idea of clothes that had a multiplicity of uses, such as reversible coats, the all-purpose dress with sets of accessories, skirts that came apart to make capes or shrugs that could be zipped onto evening gowns, and, during World War II, pockets that looked like purses and vice versa. Some of the most obvious things, like matching jackets for dinner dresses, had eluded everyone until she thought of them, and the idea of adding feathers to an outfit was exploited by Hollywood for years.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Schiaparelli done only this, she would have secured a place in fashion history. But she did much more. It is fair to say that she took the underlying concepts of surrealism, its emphasis on the unconscious, the irrational and daring, and translated them into items of fashion. She made hats look like lamb cutlets, high-heeled shoes, or clown&#x2019;s cones. Pockets were made to look like drawers, necklaces became collections of insect specimens, handbags were shaped like balloons, and buttons could be anything: lips, eyes, or carrots. The exquisite embroidery from Lesage adorned evening jackets that took their inspiration from musical instruments, vegetables, circus acrobats, or the solar system. Her clothes were smart, wearable, and sexy and marked the wearer as an individualist as well as someone with a sense of humor&#x2014;the Duchess of Windsor, after all, chose a diaphanous evening gown for her honeymoon that featured a huge pink lobster on its skirt, surrounded by some tastefully sprinkled parsley.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schiaparelli had a kind of instinct, not just for what American buyers liked&#x2014;and despite her impeccable Parisian credentials, her biggest audiences were Americans. The styles she launched: for padded shoulders, split skirts, mesh chenille snoods, shirttail jackets, bowler hats, fur shoes, and her own vivid shade of pink, called &#x201c;shocking&#x201d;&#x2014;were reproduced in the thousands. Then there were all her Shocking perfumes, each named with a word beginning with S. An astute businesswoman, she launched herself into hats, hose, soaps, shoes, handbags, and cosmetics in the space of a few years. By 1930, her company was grossing millions of francs a year. She had twenty-six workrooms and employed more than two thousand people.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schiaparelli, like Dal�, wanted to shake people out of their torpor and make them look at themselves and the world afresh. She wanted to shock, and she did shock. Then World War II arrived, and she clung on. Her workrooms on the Place Vend�me continued to function, her perfume went on being sold, and her mansion on the Right Bank stayed intact, one of the facts that led, in the end, to deep suspicions from spy agencies from Berlin and London to New York. She had shaken off the baleful influence of a self-destructive husband and fought to give their only child, Gogo, a better life after she was stricken with infantile paralysis. She had battled everything and survived, but the one thing she could not conquer was changing tastes. Women no longer wanted to be self-assertive and different, as Dior discovered in 1947 when he launched his New Look. They wanted full skirts, tight waists, a bosom, a very large hat, and high heels. Schiaparelli had lost her most vital source of inspiration&#x2014;surrealism&#x2014;and the impulse went with it. Her postwar clothes lack the inner conviction that had inspired them, and her sales dwindled away. The triumphant return of Chanel&#x2014;her clothes, for all their practicality, were always ladylike&#x2014;coincided almost to the day with the moment when Schiaparelli closed her doors. She was finished.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the decades that followed, along with the arrival of T-shirts, blue jeans, sneakers, and baseball caps, the idea of a distinctive look has, for most women, disappeared. What most women want is not to look different, as a wry cartoon in The New Yorker recently made clear. That may be true, but the allure of a beautifully made, exquisitely imagined look has not completely disappeared either, if the popularity of several recent exhibitions of haute couture is any guide. Such examples transcend mere fashion, because they speak to a deep human need. They have become works of art in themselves.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, then, is the legacy of Schiaparelli.<br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpted from <b>Elsa Schiaparelli</b> by Meryle Secrest Copyright � 2014 by Meryle Secrest.

He gave those memories expression in three songs?"Daybreak," "Trainride," and "Bosque County Romance"?that together form his "Texas Trilogy." This classic folksong has resonated with listeners from its first recording on the 1969 Frummox album From Here to There to Lyle Lovett's recent rendition on his album Step Inside This House.</p><p>In this book, Craig Hillis and Bruce Jordan offer their own take on Fromholz's "Texas Trilogy." At the heart of the book are over 140 photographs of Bosque County, Texas, which capture the moods and some of the actual locales mentioned in the songs. Accompanying them are comments from local residents, Fromholz, Hillis, and Jordan, who talk about life "in the small Texas town." In addition to the photos, Fromholz explains how he wrote "Texas Trilogy," and Hillis and Jordan discuss why the song has such enduring meaning. Hillis also provides a history of Bosque County. A digitally remastered CD of the original recording is included in the book.</p></p><p>BRUCE F. JORDAN is a freelance photographer based in Austin. His upcoming projects will continue to document the culture of the Southwest, as well as social issues.</p><h2>The Half-Mammals of Dixie</h2><p>George Singleton, who's had many stories published in the best literary journals, has recently burst into the big time with appearances in Playboy, Zoetrope, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's Magazine and Book. The stories in his new collection are wild and wooly - or maybe we should say wild and half-wooly. In any case, they're definitely not for the creationist crowd or for the laughter impaired. For example:<p> - A self-described "primitive artist," getting rich off religious canvases, is mistaken for a faith healer.</p><p> - A lovelorn dad woos his third grader's teacher with very special show-and-tells, including long lost love letters to Shakespeare from Anne Hathaway, to Fred Astaire from Ginger Rogers, and to Henry VIII from all of his wives.</p><p> - A boy's reputation is ruined forever when he accepts the starring role in a documentary on diagnosing head lice.</p><p> Off-the-wall. But also utterly believable and written with tremendous affection for the people and their place-a place called Forty-Five, part of the contemporary South that's far removed from big city Atlanta or proper Charleston and, in fact, much like Singleton's own hometown of Dacusville, South Carolina. As he says of his characters, "They're regular people just trying to get by. Most of them aren't jaded by everyday life, though perhaps they should have been long ago. There are some with physical and mental limitations, but I hope all of them have heart."</p><p> They do indeed, just like their stories. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>While it often seems true that every town in America has become depressingly alike, fully franchised and chain-stored to death, short story writer George Singleton offers a compelling rebuttal in his second collection, <i>The Half-Mammals of Dixie</i>. Almost all 15 of its stories are set in or around a fictional South Carolina town called Forty Five, and Singleton's eccentric characters--flea-market hustlers, a fish aquarium salesman, a bogus "primitive" artist--are hard to imagine outside the narrow civic boundaries of his singular imagination.<p> A writing teacher and ashtray-collecting, flea-market hound himself, Singleton builds most of his stories around first-person narrators, evoking such writers as Flannery O'Connor, Barry Hannah, and Raymond Carver, but infusing each tale with his own brand of sly humor and outsider skepticism. Singleton is particularly good at capturing the rhythms and peculiarities of southern speech, as in this passage from "When Children Count": "You sound exactly like my dead sister," this woman said, pushing her full cart into Tammy's backside. "I ain't never heard nothing like that. Say this: 'I will never, ever order a club sandwich here, what with the ptomaine.' Say it. Say." </p><p> While most of the stories are funny--"Richard Petty Accepts National Book Award" is an absolute marvel of conception and execution--a few of the tales that hit hardest are much darker. Especially haunting is "Bank of America," which centers around four childhood friends who still gather annually as adults in a swamp-land tree house, from which they fish for turtles and are forced, one fateful year, to confront the consequences of past misdeeds. Despite the story's title, which refers to a character who works at a national chain of banks, Singleton tells the story in a voice that's as unique as the flawed, but mostly likable, characters who populate his hometown. <i>--Keith Moerer</i></p>Published in hardcover by Algonquin Books, 2002, 1-56512-354-9 <br></p><h2>The Truth About Lorin Jones</h2><p>Polly Aller, a single parent and compassionate feminist, researches the untimely death of painter Lorin Jones, only to be exposed to fast-paced worlds beyond her experiece and her own difficult questions</p><p>In her wry, ironic manner, Lurie ( Foreign Affairs ) integrates two themes into this diverting novel, one a comic send-up of radical feminists and the other an exploration of the relationship between an artist's life and her art. The two issues coincide for protagonist Polly Alter. Having separated from her husband rather than follow him to his new job in Denver, Polly has taken a leave from a New York museum where she is an assistant curator to research a biography of an unjustly neglected woman artist, Lorin Jones. Though Lorin died 20 years ago, Polly feels many affinities with the artist, who was, she thinks, a victim of the male establishment. But as she interviews the people in Lorin's lifeincluding her former husband, a distinguished art critic, and her elusive former lover, a poet-turned-contractorshe receives widely contradictory versions of what Lorin was like. Polly's confusion is heightened when Jeanne, a lesbian friend with whom she now shares her apartment, convinces Polly that she too is a lesbian. But Polly's real trouble is that she is a wimp, foolishly letting herself be exploited by Jeanne in much the same way that feminists claim women traditionally have been abused by men. Miserable because her image of Lorin has been tarnished, and guilty because she feels herself falling in love with Lorin's erstwhile lover, Polly finally throws off her emotional blinders and acknowledges that the "truth" about both Lorin and herself must encompass all of their contradictory traits. Written with a light but wicked touch, this is an engaging read. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.As chronicler of the life and work of brilliant artist Lorin Jones, Polly Altermuseum curator and would-be painterat first has it all figured out. Lorin, left to die alone in Key West, was done in by the white, male art establishment. But as Polly's interviewing progresses, Lorin comes down from her pedestal, and her "villains" emerge as likeable persons; at the same time, some of the truths about Polly's life are shattered or realigned. In her eighth novel, Lurie explores a trick of the human mindhow people and events are not always as they seem at first takeby smoothly interspersing straight narrative with cleverly constructed one-sided interviews. For all her skill, however, the novel bogs down in the middle with too much of a good thing, and the ending, although surprising, is a disappointment. Lurie fans will want to read this anyway.

Its sequel, <i>The Meaning of Truth</i>, is its imperative and inevitable companion. The definitive texts of both works are here available for the first time in one volume, with an introduction by the distinguished contemporary philosopher A. J. Ayer.</p><p>In <i>Pragmatism</i> James attacked the transcendental, rationalist tradition in philosophy and tried to clear the ground for the doctrine he called radical empiricism. When first published, the book caused an uproar. It was greeted with praise, hostility, ridicule. Determined to clarify his views, James collected nine essays he had written on this subject before he wrote <i>Pragmatism</i> and six written later in response to criticisms by Bertrand Russell and others. He published <i>The Meaning of Truth in 1909</i>, the year before his death.</p><p>These two works show James at his best full of verve and good humor. Intent upon making difficult ideas clear, he is characteristically vigorous in his effort to make them prevail.</p></p><p>James attacks the transcendental, rationalist tradition in philosophy and tries to clear the ground for the doctrine he called radical empiricism.William James (1842 &#x2013;1910) was a pioneering American psychologist and philosopher who was trained as a physician. He wrote influential books on the young science of psychology, educational psychology, psychology of religious experience and mysticism, and on the philosophy of pragmatism. He was the brother of novelist Henry James and of diarist Alice James. William James was born at the Astor House in New York City. He was the son of Henry James Sr., an independently wealthy and notoriously eccentric Swedenborgian theologian well acquainted with the literary and intellectual elites of his day. The intellectual brilliance of the James family milieu and the remarkable epistolary talents of several of its members have made them a subject of continuing interest to historians, biographers, and critics. James interacted with a wide array of writers and scholars throughout his life, including his godfather Ralph Waldo Emerson, his godson William James Sidis, as well as Charles Sanders Peirce, Bertrand Russell, Josiah Royce, Ernst Mach, John Dewey, Walter Lippmann, Mark Twain, Horatio Alger, Jr., Henri Bergson and Sigmund Freud.</p><h2>Ellery Queen&#39;s Mystery Magazine, August 1969 (Vol. 54, No. 2)</h2><p>CONTENTS: ~ ~~ ~ My Brother Down There [Steve Frazee]; Miss Phipps and the Nest of Illusion [Phyllis Bentley]; Poised to Fly [Patricia Highsmith]; Merlini and the Photographic Clues [Clayton Rawson]; Murder in a Locked Box [Patrick Meadows]; Mystery of the Baghdad Chest [Agatha Christie]; The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat [Robert Twohey]; Grandfather and the Automation Mystery [Lloyd Biggle, Jr.]; Vengeance Villa [Donald Olson]; Van der Valk and the Old Seaman [Nicolas Freeling]; On the Sixth Tee [Katherine Rambeau]; The One-to-Ten Affair [Michael Gilbert]; The Little Old Lady From Cricket Creek [len Gray]; Miscarriage of Justice [Len Gray]</p><p></p><h2>Dangerous Surrender: What Happens When You Say Yes to God</h2><p>You have a plan for the rest of your life. God has a plan for the rest of your life. Are they the same? You have expectations for how your life will play out, and you hope those plans will become realities. But what if God&#39;s plan for your life is far different from what you had in mind? Can you accept that? Will you surrender your goals for God&#39;s? Kay Warren had a plan. Together with her husband, Rick Warren, author of the megaseller The Purpose Driven Life, she planned that after her kids were grown, she&#39;d travel the world, teaching and encouraging couples in ministry. It was a good plan. But it wasn&#39;t what God had in mind for her. In a startling wake-up call, Kay discovered the shocking realities of the AIDS pandemic in Africa while reading a magazine. &#39;I want to use you!&#39; she heard God say. That began the struggle---first to avoid God&#39;s call and then to surrender herself to God. She cried out to God, &#39;Why are you bothering me with this? There&#39;s nothing I can do about it. I&#39;m just an ordinary person. What could one person do about such a gigantic problem&#39; But God had grabbed her attention and wouldn&#39;t let go. If you&#39;ve ever struggled with knowing and doing God&#39;s will, this book is for you. With raw honesty, Kay goes straight to the heart of the matter: the bottom line is surrender. Will you trust God? Along the way she&#39;ll introduce you to others---people like you---who have said yes to God and have made a difference in the world. Using their skills, energy, faith, and a willingness to take risks, they became powerful instruments of change and tools in God&#39;s hands. Giving in to God isn&#39;t easy. It&#39;s not for cowards. It&#39;s the boldest, riskiest step you&#39;ll ever take. This dangerous surrender can bring both joy and pain, both heartache and ecstasy, but it enables you to know God in a far deeper way than ever before. I had to make a conscious decision. Would I retreat to my comfortable life and to my settled plans? Or would I surrender to God&#39;s call and let my heart engage with a cause such as AIDS that I was pretty sure would include buckets of pain and sorrow? I felt like I was standing on the edge of a giant precipice; I couldn&#39;t go back, and yet the way forward looked like stepping into a void. Kay Warren took that step, choosing to dangerously surrender to God. That decision transformed her life, marriage, and future. She invites you to do the same. You&#39;ll benefit most by discussing this book with others. A Readers&#39; Group Discussion Guide is provided in the back of the book.

Ella y su esposo Rick iniciaron la obra de la iglesia Saddleback en su casa, en 1980, con siete personas.Warren, wife of megachurch pastor and bestselling author Rick Warren (<i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>), traces her transformation from housewife to international HIV/AIDS advocate. Moved by a news article about AIDS, Warren made a life-changing visit to Africa in 2003. In this book, she tells stories of the world's great tragedies (HIV/AIDS, the genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia, sex slavery, orphaned children and deep poverty) through the lens of her travels. Warren challenges readers to engage with devastating situations and surrender themselves to loving others&#x2014;particularly those who may be considered outcasts&#x2014;in the name of Christ. She describes being gloriously ruined by her close knowledge of these tragic situations, having previously been unaware or simply too busy raising a family to realize what was happening in the world. . The book lacks practical suggestions for readers, demonstrating an unexpected emphasis on Warren herself and the miracle God has made of her life. At times this comes across as self-serving, especially in the midst of so much tragedy. No doubt readers will be inspired by Warren's considerable passion for the hurting world, though it remains unclear exactly what to do about it. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While there among the last-chancers known as &#34;resurrection men,&#34; he joins a covert mission to gain evidence of a drug heist orchestrated by three of his classmates. But the group has been assigned an unsolved murder that may have resulted from Rebus&#39;s own mistake. Now Rebus can&#39;t determine if he&#39;s been set up for a fall or if his disgraced classmates are as ruthless as he suspects. When Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke discovers that her investigation of an art dealer&#39;s murder is tied to Rebus&#39;s inquiry, the two-prot�g� and mentor-join forces. Soon they find themselves in the midst of an even bigger scandal than they had imagined-a plot with conspirators in every corner of Scotland and deadly implications about their colleagues. With the brilliant eye for character and place that earned him the name &#34;the Dickens of Edinburgh,&#34; Ian Rankin delivers a page-turning novel of intricate suspense.</p><p>Like Edinburgh inspector John Rebus, the resurrection men of the title are treading on thin ice--they've all been sent to a short course at the Scottish Police College because they've failed in some way, generally "an issue with authority." Rebus has been known to have issues of that nature before, which only boosts his credibility with the other cops in attendance, suspected by their bosses of being on the wrong side of the fence, on the take, or even guilty of murder on several previous occasions. The dour Inspector's agenda aims to bring the higher-ups proof of the so-called Wild Bunch's nefarious activities; in the process, his own conduct in the old case he and his college classmates must rework and revisit comes under scrutiny. A solid police procedural whose protagonist, the hero of 14 other titles in this internationally acclaimed series, continues to grow on readers who are just discovering him. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Ian Rankin is a #1 international bestselling author.

The Marines gave him food and clothing, taught him English, sent him to church, and paid for his schooling. But when the communists took over China in 1949, Love Company was forced out of the country, and Charlie was left behind.<br>Back home the Marines moved on with their lives, yet they could not forget their young friend. Charlie, refusing to denounce his connection with the Americans, suffered immensely at the hands of the Maoist government.<br>After thirty-five years, seventeen as a political prisoner, he finally managed to contact some of his old Marine Corps friends. They, in turn, joined together again to help bring Charlie to America. Numerous obstacles had to be overcome, but eventually, with irrepressible pluck, Charlie made his way to the United States in 1983, and two years later he was able to bring his family to this country as well - a true realization of the American dream.</p><p>David Perlmutt is a journalist at the Charlotte Observer in North Carolina.At the end of World War II in 1945, some U.S. Marines stationed in northern China befriended an 11-year-old boy who brought them food and firewood in exchange for money. The men nicknamed the resourceful lad Charlie Two Shoes and promised to bring him to the U.S. when their tour of duty ended. This heartwarming account tracks Charlie Two Shoes' life in China and his eventual reconciliation with his marine comrades nearly 50 years later. When relations softened between the two countries in 1980, the 45-year-old married father contacted his former marine buddies by mail.

A hidden valley on the border of England and Wales preserves a longtime feud between two border families as well as an ancient Templar church with a secret that may be linked to a famous ghost story. On her own and under pressure with the nights drawing in, the hesitant Merrily has never been less sure of her ground. Meanwhile, Merrily&#x2019;s closest friend, songwriter Lol Robinson, is drawn into the history of his biggest musical influence, the tragic Nick Drake, and finds himself troubled by Drake&#x2019;s eerie autumnal song "The Time of No Reply."</p></p><p>Phil Rickman lives on the Welsh border where he writes and presents the book programme Phil the Shelf on BBC Radio Wales. He is the author of seven Merrily Watkins&#39; Mysteries, introducing the Reverend in The Wine of Angels, and charting her career as the diocesan exorcist with Midwinter of the Spirit, A Crown of Lights, The Cure of Souls, The Lamp of the Wicked, The Prayer of the Night Shepherd, The Smile of a Ghost and The Remains of an Altar.British author Rickman once again cleverly blends supernatural elements with a conventional whodunit plot in his ninth Merrily Watkins novel (after 2007's <i>The Remains of an Altar</i>). An apparition resembling the ghost in M.R. James's short tale, Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad, has appeared at an abandoned house near the Welsh border that's to be restored by a trust connected with Prince Charles. When Felix Barlow, the builder set to do the renovation, complains about the ghost, the bishop of Hereford orders Watkins, a minister who specializes in exorcism cases, to investigate. After Barlow is found bludgeoned to death, suspicion falls on his beautiful assistant, Fuchsia Mary Linden, who appears to have committed suicide out of remorse. Doubtful of the official line, Watkins does her own digging. The writing and characterizations are first-rate, though Rickman gives away part of the game rather earlier than most mystery fans would like. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He became a central figure of the avant-garde early in his life and remained at that pinnacle until his death in 1992 at the age of eighty. Now award-winning biographer Kenneth Silverman gives us the first comprehensive life of this remarkable artist. We follow Cage from his Los Angeles childhood&#x2014;his father was a successful inventor&#x2014;through his stay in Paris from 1930 to 1931, where immersion in the burgeoning new musical and artistic movements triggered an explosion of creativity in him and, after his return to the States, into his studies with the seminal modern composer Arnold Schoenberg. We see Cage&#x2019;s early experiments with sound and percussion instruments, and watch as he develops his signature work with prepared piano, radio static, random noise, and silence. We learn of his many friendships over the years with other composers, artists, philosophers, and writers; of his early marriage and several lovers, both female and male; and of his long relationship with choreographer Merce Cunningham, with whom he would collaborate on radically unusual dances that continue to influence the worlds of both music and dance.<br><br>Drawing on interviews with Cage&#x2019;s contemporaries and friends and on the enormous archive of his letters and writings, and including photographs, facsimiles of musical scores, and Web links to illustrative sections of his compositions, Silverman gives us a biography of major significance: a revelatory portrait of one of the most important cultural figures of the twentieth century.</p><p>Kenneth Silverman&#x2019;s previous books include <i>A Cultural History of the American Revolution; The Life and Times of Cotton Mather; Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance; Houdini!!!; </i>and <i>Lightning Man: The Accursed Life of Samuel F. B.

A professor emeritus of<i> </i>English at New York University, he lives in New York City.Chapter 1<br><br>COMES UP FAMOUS<br>&#x2014;headline, Los Angeles Times<br><br>1912&#x2013;1937<br><br>The Cage Family; Los Angeles High School;<br><br>Pomona College<br><br>John Cage&#x2019;s achievement, the Times observed, was &#x201c;a matter of pride to the people of California.&#x201d; A front-page photo showed Cage waving to ten thousand spectators who had gathered to cheer him, including the mayor of Los Angeles. Telegrams announcing his triumph had been sent to President Woodrow Wilson.<br><br>Coming up famous on June 11, 1913, John Milton Cage and his crew of five had stayed underwater more than twenty-four hours, doubling the world record for submergence. The seventy-five-foot-long vessel&#x2014;named Peace Keeper&#x2014;had been built under his patents, as general manager of the Los Angeles Submarine Boat Company. When tested six months earlier, the Peace Keeper sank due to shifting ballast and an open hatchway. It had to be raised off the bottom of Los Angeles Harbor and dragged through mud back to its slip, to be pumped out.<br><br>The Times assessed the launching of &#x201c;the Cage submarine&#x201d; as &#x201c;one of the most important events that has ever occurred in California or the entire country.&#x201d; It was believed in Washington that submarines would be key weapons in future wars (such perhaps as World War I, to break out one year later). And Cage had invented novel devices to keep his sub level, increase its speed, and greatly improve its safety by running the engines on gasoline rather than potentially explosive storage batteries. A rear admiral of the U.S. Navy predicted that it would replace all other submarines in use. Not to mention, as John Cage boasted, that his Peace Keeper was the only sub in which the underwater crew could smoke.<br><br>About twenty-seven years old at the time, John Milton Cage had been born in Los Angeles, the son of a Methodist minister. His formal education ended with graduation from a high school in Denver. As he later wrote, he remained concerned with &#x201c;radical advances in thinking,&#x201d; with overthrowing &#x201c;traditional patterns?.?.?.?we have acquired through years of hard work at school.&#x201d; At a church in Denver he had met his wife, Lucretia, known as Crete. A diminutive, dark- haired woman, a few months older than her husband, she had been married once before, possibly twice. Much concerned with genealogy, she traced his ancestry to pre-Revolutionary Virginia, and her own Iowa family to Daniel Boone. The couple had had a child, whom they named John Milton Cage. But he survived only two weeks. Then on September 5, 1912&#x2014;about nine months before the triumph of <i>Peace Keeper</i>&#x2014; Lucretia gave birth in Los Angeles to another son. The couple again named him John Milton Cage, Jr.<br><br>Cage Jr. and his parents moved several times during his childhood and youth. For a while John Sr. took the family to Detroit, where he worked on automobiles and patented some improvements for internal- combustion engines. While in Michigan, Crete sustained her interest in the American past by starting a Lincoln study club. Mostly the family lived in various parts of Southern California&#x2014;Long Beach, Santa Monica, Ocean Park.<br><br>Young John Cage, Jr., was smart, sensitive&#x2014;and inventive. At Ocean Park he spent mornings on the beach building roller coasters in the sand, with tunnels and inclines on which he could roll a small rubber ball. He was also pious. When the family moved to a vine-covered bungalow in Eagle Rock, an elevated part of Los Angeles, Lucretia&#x2019;s parents lived with them. Cage remembered his grandmother as a &#x201c;very self-righteous&#x201d; woman whose main question in life was &#x201c;are YOU ready for the second coming of the Lord.&#x201d; After dinner, before going to bed, he read Bible verses with her.<br><br>Such reading played a part in young Cage&#x2019;s early education. He later remembered his time spent in elementary school as dismal. A precocious boy, he got beaten up by other children in his grade, who considered him a sissy. For religious reasons he never defended himself, taking seriously the injunction to turn the other cheek. His musical education began at about the time he reached fifth grade. When living in Santa Monica he took piano lessons from a nearby teacher. When the family moved close to Glendale, they bought him a piano and he studied with his mother&#x2019;s sister, Aunt Phoebe James. A singer, pianist, and piano teacher, she taught him to sight-read. She held recitals at which her students performed &#x2018;Pianologues.&#x2019; Costumed, they played and at the same time read aloud a short story. For a while John Jr. imagined devoting his life to performing the piano works of Grieg, which he found not too difficult, and loved.<br><br>In his early teens, during the mid-1920s, Cage Jr. grew seriously interested in radio. He was not alone. His father invented a crystal set that could be plugged into an ordinary electric light system; the 1926 Los Angeles city directory listed him as a &#x201c;radio engineer.&#x201d; The same years also brought the organization of the National Broadcasting Company and the first international radio broadcast, between London and Maine. John Jr. got the idea of hosting a radio program for the Boy Scouts. A Tenderfoot himself, he obtained permission from the organization and the approval of station KNX to broadcast a weekly show Friday afternoons. The performing Scouts spoke about their experiences building fires and tying knots. They also sang, John Jr. sometimes accompanying them on the piano. Now considering himself destined for the ministry, he began each program with an inspirational ten-minute talk by some minister, rabbi, or other notably religious person. During the two years his show stayed on the air, the volume of fan mail increased every month.<br><br>Already a serious reader, John Jr. refined and expanded his literary interests as he graduated to Los Angeles High School. His Latin teacher reportedly praised the excellence of his translations of Virgil. He studied some Greek as well, and became a contributing editor of the school&#x2019;s French newspaper. As a senior he represented Los Angeles High in the Southern California Oratorical Contest at Hollywood Bowl. His clear, effective speech concerned relations between the United States and Latin America, a subject much in the news. In 1925, U.S. troops entered the Panama territory to quell a labor revolt; next year marines landed in Nicaragua to subdue an insurrection. Cage Jr. argued that Uncle Sam had rid many countries of the curse of revolution and protected them from European domination. On the other hand, some American capitalists selfishly exploited the southern republics, which view these profiteers as representing the United States. To prove that &#x201c;man can surpass misunderstanding,&#x201d; he called on Latin Americans to accept America&#x2019;s help in making themselves fit for self-government and on American capitalists to &#x201c;cleanse our hands of gold-dust.&#x201d;<br><br>Young Cage&#x2019;s speech won the oratorical contest, and he graduated Los Angeles High as class valedictorian. The school yearbook characterized seniors by letters of the acrostic ROMAN. For his R(ecreation) he received &#x201c;<i>orating</i>&#x201d;; for A(spiration) he got &#x201c;<i>to earn</i> <i>a</i> D.D.<i> and</i> Ph.D.&#x201d;; and for N(oted for) he received a quite John Cage, Sr.&#x2013;like &#x201c;<i>being radical</i>.&#x201d; Despite thoughts of becoming a Methodist minister, he grew attracted at this time to the Liberal Catholic church in the Hollywood Hills. He liked what he remembered as the theatrical bits of its rituals&#x2014;candles, processions, clouds of incense&#x2014;and decided to become an acolyte in the church. His parents strenuously objected, however, and he gave up the idea.<br><br>Having excelled in high school and skipped some grades, Cage Jr. entered Pomona College the same month that he turned sixteen. But his college career was brief and without academic distinction. The future Doctor of Divinity earned only a B in Orientation to Religion, with Cs in gym, sports, and choir. He received As only for an introductory English course and for English Short Story Writing. Under the name &#x201c;Jonathan Cage&#x201d; (to distinguish himself from his father?), he published a short story in the school&#x2019;s literary magazine, <i>Manuscript</i>. Entitled &#x201c;The Immaculate Medawewing,&#x201d; it featured a young aesthete named Verlaine who abhors dirt in whatever form&#x2014;sticky carpets, rotten eggs, dandruff. Verlaine&#x2019;s young female friend Elicia tries to convince him that his worship of cleanliness has kept him &#x201c;beauty- blind,&#x201d; unable to appreciate certain forms of art. He tries to alter his tastes but fails, unable to accept a sandwich crawled by flies.<br><br>John Jr. also published a delicate nine-line poem entitled &#x201c;Song Ghosts.&#x201d; The subject&#x2014;ambient sound&#x2014;would become of urgent importance to him:<br><br>And there&#x2019;s a song<br><br>That&#x2019;s in the air; that growing<br><br>Floats forever far: a weak,<br><br>Yet swinging, flowing, swaying melody.<br><br>The college newspaper identified him as a &#x201c;prominent campus writer.&#x201d; But despite his literary successes, his experiences at Pomona left him, like his father, disenchanted with education. After two years at college he dropped out. He not only dropped out. The seventeen-year- old roller-coaster builder, Grieg pianist, radio personality, disappointed Liberal Catholic acolyte, short-story writer, and poet took off&#x2014;hitchhiking to Houston, then taking a boat to Le Havre.</p><h2>The Grey Fox: The True Story of Bill Miner - Last of the Old-Time Bandits</h2><p>The life story of an oldtime American Robin Hood reads like a good western as it traces the criminal career of Bill Miner--a train robber who stole but never killed, and whose charisma charmed even his victims.</p><p>A recounting of the turn-of-the-century exploits of Bill Miner, ``one of the most wanted outlaws in North America.'' He also turns out to have been one of the least colorful. Dugan (Interdisciplinary Studies/Appalachian State Univ.) and Boessenecker (Badge and Buckshot, 1988) attempt to breathe dramatic life into their protagonist with frequent references to Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy, et al., but Miner, it seems, was about as exciting as oatmeal. Born in 1846 in Michigan, he moved in 1860 with his family to the California gold-rush town of Yankee Jims. Soon, the teenager began his criminal career, starting out by stealing horses, then moving up to robbing stagecoaches. When trains replaced coaches, Miner made the switch with aplomb, though his success was spotty: During his career, he spent more than 30 years at San Quentin and other jails. Many of his escapades were almost comic, complete with slipping masks, uncooperative sticks of dynamite, and hoboes wandering unwittingly onto the scene. Meanwhile, the authors contend that Miner was the first gay outlaw in the Old West--but their evidence for this claim is nebulous. That the bandit engaged in homosexual activities while behind bars is unsurprising, and that he frequently traveled with young men is hardly irrefutable proof that he was gay. Because, in his later years, ``Old Bill'' invariably targeted the widely hated railroads, he acquired a reputation for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. From the evidence here, though, his generosity was largely imaginary. The authors are at their best, however, when discussing the folkloric elements in Miner's ``Robin Hood'' reputation. Occasionally diverting but mostly as grim as a sheriff's posse. (Seventy-three photos.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Miner's criminal career began in the 1860s and ended in 1911, two years before his death in prison. A gentleman robber of trains and stagecoaches, never a murderer, he believed that the railroad companies robbed the public and that he therefore had a right to rob them back. Although Dugan ( Bandit Years , Sunstone Pr., 1987) and Boessenecker ( Badge and Buckshot , Univ. of Oklahoma Pr., 1988) present evidence of Miner's sometime homosexuality and drug use, in his own day he was better known for his kindness to women and children. He became a folk hero in Canada and the United States, a wily rogue people would rather help than hand over to the authorities. Containing original newspaper stories, "Wanted" posters, and analysis of the outlaw folk hero phenomenon, this biography will appeal to Western scholars as well as fans of the 1983 film about Miner, The Grey Fox .<br><i>- Keddy Ann Outlaw, Harris Cty.

He lives near Fort Worth, Texas, with his wife, Sally, and their two children.<b>PART ONE</b><p><b>Making a Champion</b></p><p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p><b>A Fighter&#x2019;s Chance</b></p><p>My brother was the one constant in my life until John du Pont murdered him.</p><p>Dave protected me, he set an example for me, and he suffered alongside me. Although born seventeen months apart&#x2014;Dave was older&#x2014;we were almost like twins.</p><p>The media liked to point out our differences. We looked different. Dave sported a thick, black beard most of his adult life and I was clean-shaven, making my dominant cheek and chin features more pronounced. My medium-brown hair was thick and wavy; Dave kept his hair shorter. Then later, Father Time made his hair even shorter. I was noticeably more muscular, Dave more chemistry professor&#x2013;ish.</p><p>We wrestled differently, too, the media said. Dave was a brilliant technician on the mat. Perhaps our sport&#x2019;s greatest technician ever. I relied more on sheer strength, brute force even.</p><p>Sports Illustrated once portrayed Dave as &#x201c;a Yoda-like master of the mats,&#x201d; capable of outsmarting opponents. I was the &#x201c;sledgehammer,&#x201d; &#x201c;a massively muscled head-on attacker&#x201d; brawling my way to victory.</p><p>The contrasts made for great stories. Perhaps that&#x2019;s why we played along for fun during interviews. But the true story, despite the obvious physical differences, was how much alike we were. And the better story would have been how much that was by design, because I tried to emulate my older brother in every way I could.</p><p>Ours had all the makings of a rags-to-riches tale. From poor beginnings, we fought our way through life and the world of wrestling to win a combined four National Collegiate Athletic Association championships, two Olympic gold medals, and three World Championship titles. But riches never came. We won plenty of gold, but we never found the brass ring that would allow us to compete without having to rely on the likes of John du Pont, a credibility-craving, controlling misfit of a multimillionaire I never would have associated with if USA Wrestling had provided better financial support for its most successful wrestlers.</p><p>Our parents divorced when I was three. Our dad and our mom didn&#x2019;t have one of those nasty divorces, so we didn&#x2019;t have to deal with parents trashing each other. We also were really close to our grandparents on our mom&#x2019;s side, and as far as kids of divorces go, we didn&#x2019;t have it too bad in our early years.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t quite yet five when I started school in Menlo Park, California, and as an October baby, I was the youngest in my class. Dave was a grade ahead and, unlike me, one of the bigger kids in his class. But Dave, who would eat just about anything and everything, was soft and uncoordinated. His physique would later result in his being nicknamed &#x201c;Pudge.&#x201d;</p><p>Dave&#x2019;s lack of coordination came from his dyslexia. Instead of having one side of the brain that is dominant, which is what influences how people think and operate, individuals diagnosed with dyslexia have a brain with mixed dominance, and that negatively affects the brain&#x2019;s organization.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Dave had great difficulty reading. The letters b, d, p, and q flipped back and forth, up and down when he read. Dave&#x2019;s teachers placed him in remedial classes. Dave hated those classes because, like many dyslexics, he actually was very intelligent.</p><p>�</p><p>One day when Dave was a third-grader, a kid from his grade started making fun of him for being in remedial reading. Dave got mad, took the kid to the ground, and slammed his head against the concrete. That knocked the kid out, and an ambulance had to come to the school to take the kid to the hospital. Dave had cracked the kid&#x2019;s skull.</p><p>After that, Dave became known as the toughest kid in the school and, not surprisingly, didn&#x2019;t have to face teasing again for being in remedial reading. We did get picked on a lot, though, and I still don&#x2019;t know why. I remember one time when a group of girls kept calling me &#x201c;conceited.&#x201d; They might have said that at least a dozen times, maybe a couple of dozen, in about an hour.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t think I was conceited. I was a good athlete and I wasn&#x2019;t real talkative, but I wouldn&#x2019;t say I was conceited. I was small, though, and that made me an easy target.</p><p>One bully in particular kept picking on me, and that&#x2019;s when my protector stepped in on my behalf. Dave took the bully down and pounded on him until the bully started crying and got up and ran home.</p><p>Dave got cross with another kid at school named John. I can&#x2019;t remember what started their rift, but I think John had disrespected Dave. They agreed to settle it on the playground after school. Word got around that John and Dave were going to fight, and there was a lot of interest in the outcome because Dave was the school&#x2019;s tough guy and John was one of the best athletes, really coordinated and extremely fast.</p><p>After school, the kids formed a circle around John and Dave, and John quickly was revealed as no match for Dave. They wound up on the ground, and Dave got on top of him and started pounding on him. Dave&#x2019;s fists were flying, John&#x2019;s arms were trying to cover his head, and both kids were crying&#x2014;John, on the bottom, because he was getting beat up, and Dave, on top, I guess because it was one of those deals where you&#x2019;re a kid in a fight and you have so much adrenaline flowing and you have no idea what&#x2019;s going to happen after the fight. A teacher heard the commotion and separated the two.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know how Dave wound up on top of a kid as athletic as John so quickly, but he must have detected a spot where John left himself vulnerable and pounced on it. He was an excellent technician long before he discovered wrestling.</p><p>Even though because of my size I was more on the edge of the action than in the middle of it, fighting became a defense for both of us. We didn&#x2019;t have many advantages, but we did have toughness and the bullheadedness to never give in going for us.</p><p>My parents had told me after I turned four that I had six-pack abs and well-defined muscles, but my first recognition of my athletic talent came in second grade, when another student boasted that he could outrun me across a field. He took off before I could get started, but despite the boy&#x2019;s big head start, I caught up to him and beat him to the finish line.</p><p>That race provided me needed confidence, because even though I was the youngest member of the class, I learned I could do something athletically better than others. I was way too young to know about the science of fast-twitch muscle fibers that I would learn about in college, but discovering how quick I was compared with the others in my class led me to realize the advantage I had in terms of explosive power. After that boost of confidence, I became the goalkeeper in our recess soccer games and usually went back to class covered in dirt from diving to make saves. For the first time, I experienced the joy of being the best at something in sports.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Our mother had remarried and attended graduate school at Stanford. Before my fourth-grade year, she accepted a job offer to be the costume designer for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon, the first city across the California border on Interstate 5. The move took us more than a six-hour drive from our home in Palo Alto, away from our dad and grandparents.</p><p>We had a good relationship with Dad. He and Mom gave me Dad&#x2019;s middle name&#x2014;Philip&#x2014;when I was born. My first name came from an uncle, Mark Bernstein, and I didn&#x2019;t like my name growing up because &#x201c;Mark&#x201d; sounded like a hare-lipped dog barking. Then I learned the name came from Mars, the Roman god of war, and I thought it was cool that I carried the name of a warrior.</p><p>Dad, a Stanford grad, was a comedian and drama professor, and he kept us laughing when we were around him. In our early years in Palo Alto, I developed a love for comedy, memorizing all of Steve Martin&#x2019;s A Wild and Crazy Guy album. Our maternal grandparents Willis and Dorothy Rich were smart and accomplished people; Grandpa was a professor at Stanford, and Grandma was a doctor. While our mom worked in the summers, we stayed with them in nearby Menlo Park, and they loved on us every time we were with them. My grandmother and I grew especially close. But then we moved.</p><p>I hated Oregon. Not because of Oregon itself, but because moving there took me away from the positive influences of my dad and grandparents. I recently told my mom, Jeannie St. Germain, that I still have negative feelings toward Oregon and wished that we had never moved there, because that is where life began to turn difficult for me.</p><p>Mom and our stepdad had two more kids, Seana and Michael, whom I&#x2019;ve always considered full-blooded siblings. Then Mom got divorced again and her parents passed away. She had a brother who stayed distant and wasn&#x2019;t around to help her (or us) at all. Her job with the Shakespeare Festival was one of the best theater jobs in the country, but it didn&#x2019;t leave her much time for us because she had to work a lot of hours to support us financially. Mom definitely made personal sacrifices to raise us the best she could.</p><p>Our house in Ashland was pretty small, probably about twelve hundred square feet. There was my mom&#x2019;s room, a room Seana and Michael shared, and a room that Dave and I could have made ours. But that room had glass walls&#x2014;a sunroom type of room&#x2014;and was cold most of the time because it wasn&#x2019;t insulated. So we took up residence in a little building out back that we called &#x201c;the bunkhouse.&#x201d;</p><p>The bunkhouse was uncomfortable and cold. There were no beds; we slept on cots and wrapped ourselves in sleeping bags. The walls were insulated, but the handle had fallen off the door and cold air whisked right through the opening. The bunkhouse had a small electric heater we would huddle over in the morning, with sleeping bags draped over our backs, to warm up before we dressed for school.</p><p>We lived a dirty existence there. The road to our house was all dirt and filled with potholes. Some of our neighbors were sheep farmers. We didn&#x2019;t have a lot of clothes, and the items we did have were dirty, and we didn&#x2019;t wash them often. In sixth grade, I had worn the same pair of socks for so long that the bottoms had become black and hard.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s sick, Schultzy,&#x201d; one of my teachers told me when she saw my socks.</p><p>It was painfully embarrassing. Those were awful times, but going through them made Dave and me tough and independent. We had to grow up faster than most other kids around us.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The transition from Palo Alto to Ashland was difficult. I hated our elementary school in Ashland. I was almost four hundred miles away from my dad and grandparents, and the winters were cold in that freezing bunkhouse. I couldn&#x2019;t wait for the weather to warm up so I could build up calluses on the bottoms of my feet that would enable me to hike barefoot on Mount Ashland behind Lithia Park.</p><p>To me, school was boring, so I tapped into the comedian gene passed along from my dad to create fun. I would listen to Bill Cosby&#x2019;s vinyl records over and over at home, memorizing his stories so I could repeat them for my classmates and make them laugh.</p><p>I was a good, natural athlete; Dave wasn&#x2019;t. We both had stiff shoulders and couldn&#x2019;t throw balls as far as some of the other boys. Neither of us was good at distance running, either.</p><p>Sixth grade was a big year for me in sports, because I broke twenty of the school&#x2019;s twenty-five athletic records for my grade. Classmates voted me &#x201c;most likely to win the Olympic long jump.&#x201d; Winning that honor was cool because I remembered Dave and me watching the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City when American Bob Beamon pulled off one of the greatest feats in all of sports, breaking the world record in the long jump by an amazing 213/4 inches.</p><p>In those days I didn&#x2019;t watch the Olympics and dream of some day competing in the Games. At that point I was still trying to figure out which sport I would make mine. I was good at many sports, so when I thought about specializing in a sport I thought it should be one at which I could make a lot of money because we were so poor.</p><p>During sixth grade, I read the book American Miler: The Life and Times of Glenn Cunningham, about one of the best Americans in the mile run during the 1930s. Cunningham competed in two Olympics and won the silver medal in the fifteen hundred meters at the 1936 Games in Berlin.</p><p>Cunningham&#x2019;s legs had been badly burned during a schoolhouse explosion, and doctors told him he would never walk again. The book described how Cunningham did learn to walk again and developed a running style in which he ran on the balls of his feet and placed one foot directly in front of the other, as though he were running on a straight line. I copied his form, and that gave me a bit of a distinct walk. I had the pleasure and honor of meeting Cunningham in 1988 and was able to tell him how he had affected the way I walked and ran. A week after we met, Cunningham died.</p><p>Dave took up wrestling in seventh grade. He made our junior high&#x2019;s junior varsity, and he had a 3-3-1 record in his first season. Dave absolutely fell in love with wrestling from the start. By that time, the other boys in his grade had caught up with him in size, so Dave used wrestling to maintain his status as the toughest kid in school. I loved Dave being the toughest kid, especially because I was the youngest in my grade and not very big compared with the others. Dave didn&#x2019;t miss a chance to step in and take up for me when I got bullied.</p><p>I think finding wrestling was a eureka moment for Dave. His reading troubles didn&#x2019;t matter in wrestling, but brutality did, and he had plenty of that. Plus, because he was so smart, he could take moves others did and improve them, and then create his own moves. Even when he first started wrestling, Dave could trick opponents into putting themselves in a position they thought would give them an advantage only to quickly learn they had instead stepped into Dave&#x2019;s trap. By then, it was too late.</p><p>Becoming a better wrestler was about the only thing Dave cared about. He carried his wrestling shoes with him at all times and wore a singlet underneath his clothes just in case he met up with someone who wanted to wrestle.</p><p>As Dave got into wrestling, we discovered that because his brain wasn&#x2019;t dominated by one side due to his dyslexia, he appeared to have the advantage of being ambidextrous. He wrote and threw with his left hand, kicked with his right foot, and shot guns right-eye dominant. Because he was neither left- nor right-handed, Dave was able to perform moves equally well from both sides. Opponents had trouble figuring out Dave&#x2019;s style and also were left vulnerable due to Dave&#x2019;s being able to attack a wrestler&#x2019;s weaker side&#x2014;whichever side it was&#x2014;with equal strength.</p><p>Because Dave basically lived wrestling, he rapidly improved. He made the junior high&#x2019;s varsity his eighth-grade year and placed fourth in the state. As a ninth-grader&#x2014;our high school started with the tenth grade&#x2014;he wrestled at the World Schoolboy Championships in Lima, Peru, and finished second behind a wrestler from Great Britain.</p><p>I was blown away that Dave had risen so fast in such a difficult sport. He, however, didn&#x2019;t make a big deal out of his accomplishments. He had a steady demeanor about him that would have kept you...</p></p><h2>Book of Ghosts : An Imagination Book</h2><p>Rhyming text and die-cut pages present a ghost at the window, a ghost in the water tap, and ghosts everywhere you look.</p><p></p><h2>Power, Holiness and Evangelism: Rediscovering God&#39;s Purity, Power, and Passion for the Lost</h2><p><p>Why has the Church of the latter century not seen the exponential growth of the early Church in the first century?

She is a heroine to love--brave but pragmatic, utterly human. This delicious story will seduce you and leave you desperate for just one more page -- Leigh Bardugo, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom Stands out amid a plethora of fairy-court fantasies . . . Complex, nuanced characters, frank sensuality and thorn-sharp, intricate storytelling all conspire to ensnare. * Guardian * Whatever a reader is looking for-heart-in-throat action, deadly romance, double-crossing, moral complexity-this is one heck of a ride * Booklist * I require book two immediately. Holly Black is the Faerie Queen. * Victoria Aveyard * An enjoyable read * SFX Magazine * I am awarding this book 5*/5 with no hesitation - it was lively, gripping, exciting, and had some amazing plot twists which kept me turning the pages * Sammy&#39;s Shelf * It&#39;s only a week into 2018 and I&#39;ve already fallen in love with a new author, Holly Black. I know I&#39;m extremely late to this party, but wow her books are good. If you like faeries but also messy and complicated humans, trust me you&#39;ll love her! * What Rhi Read * In this story Holly Black has once again proved why she is known by some as the &#39;Queen of Faerie&#39; because she successfully creates a dark, twisted world inspired by the old folktales where the fae are capricious and cruel, yet sets it alongside a modern world that feels all too familiar * Chrikaru Blog * Holly Black creates an enticing world that&#39;s as sinister as it is appealing, and a heroine more than equipped to manoeuvre within. Impossible not to enjoy. Shadowhunters fan should read this at their earliest opportunity * SciFi Now * A veritable queen of dark fantasy, Holly Black spins a thrilling tale of intrigue and magic in her newest novel. Ten years after the faeries murdered her parents and stole her away, 17 year old Jude is fighting to be accepted by her captors. Unmissable for fans of Sarah J. Mass and the Grisha trilogy * Buzzfeed UK * This splendidly wicked and richly created story is one you won&#39;t want to miss * Buzzfeed * With brave world building, complex characters and an intriguing plot all piled into one novel, this is a huge success * The Page Is Printed * Fantasy adventure at its brilliant, intelligent, thought-provoking best * LoveReading * In this story she has once again proved why she is known by some as the &#39;Queen of Faerie because she successfully creates a dark, twisted world inspired by the old folktales where the fae are capricious and cruel, yet sets it alongside a modern world that feels all too familiar * Chrikaru Blog * A gripping tale packed with beautiful writing, a well crafted world, complex characters and fast paced action. The book definitely felt like a set up for something much bigger that I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on * Amy Jane Alice * Holly Black created a world of Faerie that is ruthless, cruel and dangerous and it&#39;s so much fun to see all of that unfold over the course of the story! * The Caffeinated Bookworm Life * The way Black spins the world is honestly mesmerizing. We&#39;ve got faerie courts of every kind, each as mysterious and bloody wicked as you can possibly imagine. The creatures are varied, from pixies to undines to goblins. She uses phrases and descriptions in the best way possible to not only make you feel like you&#39;re actually there, but you can practically taste the sickly sweet faerie fruits and the dark magic in the air * Stones of Rome * Holly Black has a way of weaving the fantastical into reality that few other authors manage with any real success. Whether she&#39;s writing about vampires or faeries, Black creates worlds so real that you risk losing yourself in them * Wondra&#39;s World * I really cannot recommend The Cruel Prince highly enough. If you&#39;ve read Holly&#39;s other books you&#39;ll get an extra kick out of it, but you don&#39;t need to, as this is a separate series. I&#39;m already dying for book 2 and I can&#39;t believe I have to wait a year for it. I&#39;m not entirely sure how I&#39;m going to cope! * The Untitled Book Blog * I can see why Holly is known as the Queen of Faeries. With this book alone, I was able to see that she knows this world well and has the ability to craft a rich and compelling story filled with evocative details that made me feel as though I were navigating Faerie myself. As if I could taste the sickening sweetness of the faerie fruit and run my fingers over the embroidery of the vibrant fabrics making up gowns for the balls. When I wasn&#39;t reading, I was thinking about the book, the characters, the impending danger which left me uneasy, until I had devoured it all. Just the right amount of things are resolved, and the explosive ending leaves the perfect set up for a sequel that could be even better than this. If, like me, you enjoy reading about morally grey characters and how far they are willing to go to gain power, then you should give this book a shot. It was my first Holly Black novel and it will certainly not be the last. I can&#39;t wait to discover what other worlds she has created - maybe that will help with the agonising wait for book 2 * Violette Books * A dark and beguiling fantasy that sees how human strengths and weaknesses can be used for good and bad. This addictive tale and its vibrant cast of characters has hints of King Arthur&#39;s Court and a knight&#39;s quest with a magical twist * South Wales Evening Post * this book knocked my socks off. Honestly, it had the perfect mix of court intrigue, well thought-out plot twists, amazing character development and sizzling chemistry (*swoon*) * Chased by my Imagination * If you love old school fairytales and a dark, twisted plot, then you must read The Cruel Prince. I&#39;m still amazed and cannot stop thinking about it * Astra Litte * Holly Black writes beautifully, that&#39;s a fact. I was hooked from the very first chapter until the very last sentence of the book, this is so addictive you can&#39;t stop reading before knowing everything. And at the end you come asking for more * Beauty and the Bookstore * This book is a real page turner! I was totally engrossed by the first chapter and it gets better and better whole the way through. I&#39;m so sad that I&#39;ve finished this book, I crave its sequel right now * MisLivsie * Packed with court intrigues, vendettas and tangled loves and lineages and betrayals * Geek Chocolate * This is a great start to a series and I&#39;m now looking for other Holly Black books to read because I love her writing style. I love all things fey and have read numerous books in a similar setting and this is one of my favourite * Shutterpug * The Cruel Prince was a refreshing read first and foremost. Void of unnecessary YA tropes and cliche characters, it made me giddy and reminded me of the days I could read YA fantasy without throwing the book across my room at least once. (Maybe there is hope yet). The story started right of the bat with gruesome murder (not a spoiler) wasting no time with finery and capturing my attention with an iron grip. And from there it went uphill. The pace was steady and fast with a captivating story line. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entirety of the time and the second half of the book, oh my lord. It was impossible to move my eyes from my book, even for a second! * Bookishues * If you&#39;re looking for an amazing book about faeries, with great characters and amazing world building, look no further. I could probably go on for days but I definitely recommend you pick this up. Regardless if you&#39;ve read any of Holly Black&#39;s previous works, it won&#39;t let you down * Midsummer Night&#39;s Read * This book was fantastic. We were given a magical world filled with wonder, fantasy and lots of bloodlust. This book has everything you could need in a Young Adult novel, a strong willed heroin, an angst filled bad boy and of course a whirlwind romance * The Star * an intriguing dark fantasy novel with a fascinating array of characters * The Owl on the Bookshelf * This is a very clever and intricate book, and I am seriously looking forward to more political intrigue, plotting, spying, murders, revenge and clever ways to avoid lying in the next installment * Book For Thought * Dark and twisted, this Faerie-tale kept me hooked from beginning to end with its glorious twists and turns * Kelly&#39;s Ramblings * A very compelling and dramatic start to what I&#39;m sure will be a very successful series. Holly Black has a way of ingeniously mixing just the right amount of action, tension, viciousness and romance in with the fantastical. She has created a fearsome world and even more fearsome characters. Jude is a force to be reckoned with, humanly flawed but fierce and strong. I loved her. The only problem now is, we have to wait until next year for the sequel. Hurry up Holly, my mortal heart could barely take the cliffhanger ending * Askews Newsletter * The Cruel Prince was a surprising and fantastic read. Though I only bought this because it was at such a good price, it has such a complex and dark plot. I couldn&#39;t help but find myself comparing it to Game of Thrones for expecting the unexpected * Book Mood Reviews * The Cruel Prince was one of the first YA fantasy books published in 2018 and whilst the whole year is still ahead of us, it&#39;s likely to be one of the best too. The long wait for book two has already begun. * Culture Fly * Jude is a brilliant, furious creature - the product of murder, danger and brutality, strength built upon her fragility and weaknesses as a mere mortal, easily swayed and damaged by the world around her. * Hux Tales *</p><h2>A Lion Among Men (Volume Three in the Wicked Years)</h2><p>A Lion Among Men (Volume Three in the Wicked Years)</p><p></p><h2>The Third Reich is Listening: Inside German codebreaking 1939&#x2013;45</h2><p><p><b>Drawing on recently declassified documents, and now available in paperback, this is the utterly compelling history of the successes and failures of the German Intelligence Services throughout World War II.</b></p><p>The success of the Allied codebreakers at Bletchley Park was one of the iconic intelligence achievements of World War II, immortalized in films such as <i>The Imitation Game</i> and <i>Enigma</i>.

The persistent State of Jefferson movement finally received national attention, including articles in Time and Life magazines, and held a boisterous election of county officials in 1941, before being derailed by the onset and priorities of World War II.

International edition.</p><p></p><h2>Italian Naval Camouflage of World War II</h2><p>This is a major new study of Italian naval camouflage schemes developed and used during World War II. When Italy entered the War in June 1940, the Regia Marina (Italian navy) was a force still under development and both Italian warships and merchant ships started the war in their peacetime colors, although prewar plans had been made for camouflaging ships.<p>At that time, all the principal warships were painted in a light matte grey ("grigio cenerino chiaro"), that was adopted in the 1920s and early '30s. With the advent of war, and the start of convoy traffic to Libya, the need to camouflage ships for purposes of deception, rather than outright concealment, became apparent and the first initiatives were undertaken.</p><p>Employing contemporary schematic drawings, photographs, and his own CAD profiles, Marco Ghiglino, describes the development of the varied schemes that were adopted for the capital ships, such as <i>Caio Duilia</i> and <i>Littorio</i>, cruisers, destroyers and torpedo boats, landing craft, and merchant ships; even the royal yacht and small tugs were given camouflage schemes. Ghiglino depicts all the ships and their schemes, at different dates, with both sides of the ship shown where possible, in his own beautifully rendered schematic profiles, all in full color. It is this section with more than 700 drawings that gives the reader a complete and detailed picture of the development of Italian naval camouflage. He also looks in detail at the Greek theater where there were many exceptions, influenced by the German presence and by the camouflage schemes of captured vessels.<br>This major new reference book will prove invaluable to historians, collectors, model makers, and wargamers and follows in the wake of the hugely successful editions covering German and British camouflage schemes of World War II.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Marco Ghiglino</b> is a serving officer in the Italian navy and has been researching naval camouflage for many years. He is an accomplished draughtsman. This is his first book.<br><br>"[<i>Italian Naval Camouflage of World War II</i>] certainly belongs on the bookshelf of anyone interested in World War 2 naval history, particularly either the Regia Marina or naval camouflage. If I needed to rate this book out of five, I would have no hesitation giving it 6 stars out of 5. Brilliant book, simply brilliant." --<i><b>Thomo's Hole</b></i><br><br>"The Italian navy of World War II was blessed with the most spectacular array of camouflage schemes of any combatant. Marco Ghiglino is the expert on this subject. The book is very comprehensive. All types and classes are thoroughly covered. Camouflage patterns are illustrated by hundreds of elevation drawings showing port and starboard views of virtually every ship commissioned by the Regia Marina. This includes not only the operational warships down to torpedo boats, but motor torpedo boats, auxiliaries and ships taken over from other navies.... This book is a modeller's gold mine. If you are looking for colour and flair for your model fleet then the Italian navy is a must. For those collecting this fleet for wargames or modelling this book is a great guide to painting." --<i><b>Wargames Illustrated</b></i></p><h2>Buried Prey (LARGE PRINT)</h2><p>A great detective story.</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Cruise Ports Caribbean (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher*</i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet&#x2019;s Cruise Ports Caribbean</b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Even a visit from Superman does nothing to help. When Adam learns that his home planet is missing, he is terrified that his wife and child are gone forever. Traveling to find them, he is captured by an armada that treats him suspiciously well. When he discovers the planet has been teleported away in an attempt to fool him, the scheme is revealed and Adam and a group of mercenary aliens fight in intergalactic space. The armada and its leader, Valkyr, turn out to be the villains. Only a passable science-fiction story, the novel has few standout moments. Adam comes across as more of a dull workman, never doing any of the delectable grandiose pontificating that great heroes do. The human element of the missing wife and daughter is rather weak, and the nonstop flow of characters stepping in from the sidelines obscure the plot, which seems contrived enough as it is. Even Adam Strange collectors may give up on this one.<i>&#x2013;John Leighton, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He applies the healing principles of God&#x2019;s Word to encourage those who have been scarred by loss of employment, health, or by the death of a loved one.</p><p><p> If you are being broken, God is working with you," writes Dr. M. R. De Haan. "He is making something--something that will someday astound you with its wisdom and beauty... The things we thought were the greatest trials and tragedies we later find to be God's way of bringing us something better. We think broken things are a loss, but God turns them to gain."</p> <p> <i>Broken Things</i> is the most popular of Dr. De Haan's many books. This is true, no doubt, because it comforts and encourages those whose lives have been shattered by illness, adversity, and painful losses. Its lessons about suffering are timeless, and the need for a proper perspective on brokenness is as relevant as ever in our world today.</p> <p> <i>Broken Things</i> brings comfort and encouragement to those who seek reasons for their suffering. Dr. De Haan writes compassionately to those who once dreamed of living "happily ever after" but now face the harsh reality of adversity. He explains how brokenness can prepare a person for maturity in his or her walk with Christ, and why being broken is a sign of God's working to refine the potential He sees in His children.</p> <p> The message of this book brings hope and peace through the healing principles of God's Word.</p> <p> "My grandfather, M. R. De Haan, has been at home with the Lord for almost forty-five years. Yet the impact of his ministry continues in the lives of men and women who heard him preach and&nbsp;who have read his writings. As one who suffered profound brokenness, M. R. knew what the good news of God's grace meant in his own life. And because God has used the words of this book to challenge and comfort people throughout the world since it was first published, we are pleased to offer it in this new edition."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;--From the Foreword by Mart De Haan</p> <p> &nbsp;</p><p>Dr. M.R.

Emphasizing Astaire&#39;s remarkable contribution to the musical film in the 35 movies he made over a period of 36 years, the book gives the backgrounds and behind-the-scenes stories of all his Broadway, London and Hollywood productions, plus complete cast and credit listings, plot outlines, excerpts from dialogue and song lyrics, newspaper reviews, and a full appraisal of the dancer&#39;s unique art. Over 800 photographs, many from the private collections of both Fred and Adele Astaire, bring every one of Fred&#39;s memorable dance creations to life as they sow him with all his leading ladies: Adele Astaire (in their ten stage musicals), Claire Luce, Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers (in all of their memorable films), Joan Fontaine, Eleanor Powell, Paulette Goddard, Rita Hayworth, Joan Leslie, Marjorie Reynolds, Lucille Bremer, Vera-Ellen, Judy Garland, Ann Miller, Betty Hutton, Jane Powell, Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron and Audrey Hepburn. In, STARRING FRED ASTAIRE contains a complete discography compiled by Howard Levine, a section devoted to every one of Fred&#39;s radio and television appearances, a listing of all the songs written by red Astaire, plus a special career-at-a-glance section showing all stage and screen credits. This is a book that does full and loving justice to the achievement of a man of whom Irving Berlin has written, &#34;His heart was in the music before his feet took over&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>Stone&#39;s Brigade And The Fight For The Mcpherson Farm</h2><p>As part of the I Corps at Gettysburg, Stone&#39;s (Bucktail) Brigade fought one of the most desperate actions of the battle. The defense of the McPherson farm bought valuable time for more Union units to arrive in the area and deploy for the ultimate victory.The Bucktail Brigade consisted of the 143rd, 149th, and 150th Pennsylvania Volunteers. The 149th were the original &#34;Bucktails&#34; and became as well-known for the deer tails stuck in their hatbands as for their distinguished work as a light infantry unit in the Virginia campaign of 1862. As with many other governments, the Pennsylvania authorities sought to increase their number of elite units by expanding a renowned regiment to brigade strength. Giving two new regiments bucktails to wear, it was hoped, would create an entire elite brigade who all fought as well as the original unit.The men of the 149th took the extension of the bucktail distinction with bad grace, and the two junior regiments initially were given all the least desirable assignments. At Gettysburg on July 1st, 1863, the two new units proved themselves by their gallant stand at McPherson&#39;s Farm and the entire brigade remained highly regarded throughout the Army of the Potomac for the rest of the war.James Dougherty describes this action in unprecedented detail, with extensive reference to the surviving diaries and eyewitness accounts. The author&#39;s extensive background in emergency medical services also gives him considerable expertise in describing the fearsome wounds sustained in this action and their subsequent treatment.</p><p></p><h2>The Return of Anti Semitism</h2><p>&#34;Although our government hardly acknowledges the fact, and fails to orient its policies accordingly,&#34; begins Gabriel Schoenfeld in this profoundly disquieting book, &#34;the United States is today locked in a conflict with adversaries for whom hatred of Jews lies at the core of their beliefs.&#34; To anyone with even a modest acquaintance with current events, it is clear that the Muslim world is today the epicenter of a particularly virulent brand of anti-Semitic hatred. But anti-Semitism has also reawakened dramatically in Europe, where it was long thought to be completely dormant if not entirely extinct. And as Schoenfeld shows, it is also making unprecedented headway in the United States, a country where it has never before found truly fertile soil. &#34;The Return of Anti-Semitism&#34; traces the confluence of several lethal currents: the infusion of judeophobia into Islamic fundamentalism; the rise of terrorist movements (including al Qaeda) that are motivated in large measure by a pathological hatred of Jews; the deliberate and well-financed export of anti-Semitism from the Muslim world into Europe and from there into the United States; and the rebirth of older anti-Semitic traditions in the West that were thought to have ended along with Nazism. Schoenfeld shows that the most vicious ideas about Jews today are not voiced by the downtrodden and disenfranchised fringe elements of society, but by its most highly educated and &#34;progressive&#34; segments. This is true in the Islamic world, and it is even truer in the West. One is less likely to find anti-Semites today in beer halls and trailer parks than among the mass media and in faculty lounges. And while yesterday&#39;s anti-Semitism appeared in periods of economic and political stress, its alarming return comes at a time when the Western democracies are secure and free from the social turmoil that contributed to the rise of fascism. An old disease, one that many assumed was permanently eradicated, has reappeared in our world. &#34;The Return of Anti-Semitism&#34; is a profound analysis of a great and growing danger.</p><p>Gabriel Schoenfeld has written on world affairs for the &#34;New York Times,&#34; the &#34;Wall Street Journal,&#34; the &#34;Washington Post,&#34; &#34;The Atlantic,&#34; the &#34;New Republic,&#34; and &#34;Commentary,&#34; where he is the senior editor. Schoenfeld holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University and lives in New York City.This is the story of how, "virtually unnoticed, and unremarked, a lethal hatred of Jews has once again come to play a large part in world events." Schoenfeld offers a pungent, well-written, argumentative analysis, drawing upon essays he wrote for Commentary (where he is a senior editor) and other right-leaning publications. Schoenfeld divides his methodical analysis into three geopolitical spheres-the Islamic world, with an increase of "a particularly virulent brand of anti-Semitic hatred"; Europe, with the resurgence of a physically violent anti-Semitism; and the U.S., where for the first time anti-Semitism may be finding strong roots "in... the left-wing radicalism that came to the fore in the late 1960s and 1970s." Schoenfeld carefully, if selectively, makes a disturbing, and at times convincing, argument that the past two decades have seen a volatile conflation of generalized anti-Semitic fury with critiques of Israeli policy. Schoenfeld's conservative leanings are evident-he mounts a strong defense of Bush's Iraq policy as a sound counter to Islamic anti-Semitism-and some readers may find some of his arguments flimsy or debatable. In particular, his dismissal of Jewish progressives-such as Rabbi Michael Lerner, Susannah Heschel and Marc Ellisas "a coterie of preening left-wing Jews" who play a "sordid role" in tacitly promoting anti-Semitism with their criticisms of Israeli social and political policy-will rankle his critics. Schoenfeld's book is part of a wave of new critiques of anti-Semitism. While more nuanced than Phyllis Chesler's The New Anti-Semitism, Schoenfeld's work is more polemical and will find a smaller audience than Abraham Foxman's Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a child, she struggled with reading and writing. But by third grade, after spending much time in her public library in Portland, Oregon, she found her skills had greatly improved. Before long, her school librarian was saying that she should write children's books when she grew up.</p><p>Instead she became a librarian. When a young boy asked her, "Where are the books about kids like us?" she remembered her teacher's encouragement and was inspired to write the books she'd longed to read but couldn't find when she was younger. She based her funny stories on her own neighborhood experiences and the sort of children she knew. And so, the Klickitat Street gang was born!</p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, presented to her in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. <em>Dear Mr. Henshaw</em> won the Newbery Medal, and <em>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</em> and <em>Ramona and Her Father</em> have been named Newbery Honor Books.

She has no toes, wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird, and gives him a stick that can make fire.<br>Daphne, sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy, almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy. Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark. She&#x2019;s certain her father, distant cousin of the Royal family, will come and rescue her but it seems, for now, that all she has for company is the boy and the foul-mouthed ship&#x2019;s parrot, until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island. Together, Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things (including how to milk a pig, and why spitting in beer is a good thing), and start to forge a new nation.<br><br>Encompassing themes of death and nationhood, Terry Pratchett&#x2019;s new novel is, as can be expected, extremely funny, witty and wise.

Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;In this first novel for young people set outside of Discworld, Pratchett again shows his humor and humanity. Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor. Daphne is a close literary cousin of Tiffany Aching in her common sense and keen intelligence wedded to courage. A rich and thought-provoking read.&#x2014;<i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The trip culminates with a surprise visit to their "umpteenth cousin, who-knows-how-many times removed," Pelham Barnavelt, who resides in genteel post-WW II poverty in the family seat, Barnavelt Manor. Together with his new-found English friend, Bertie (the blind son of Cousin Pelham's housekeeper), Lewis explores the overgrown maze on the manor's grounds. When they discover an ancient map--hidden, in classic Bellairs style, in the bindings of a crumbling book--the boys wend their way to the secret center of the maze, where a powerful evil force has long been imprisoned. Overweight, bookish and naturally timid, Lewis is nevertheless capable of true bravery; his endearing character, along with the novel's underlying current of melancholy, makes this much more than run-of-the-mill supernatural entertainment. Chock-full of deliciously spooky details and narrated in a voice that is as cozy as it is ornery, this tale is utterly spellbinding. Although Strickland (who also completed The Ghost in the Mirror ) serves him well, the late Bellairs will be greatly missed.

The Lucky Strike, a novelette first published in 1984, posits an alternate history in which the <i>Enola Gay</i> crashes on a test run before dropping the first atomic bomb. Replacement bombardier Capt. Frank January deliberately misses Hiroshima, but the Japanese analyze the explosions and surrender anyway. January is executed for disobeying orders, becoming a martyr who inspires total nuclear disarmament by 1956. Robinson's skill with human drama lends credibility to an otherwise wildly optimistic scenario. The volume also includes a short essay on whether history follows laws akin to physics, and an interview with Robinson conducted by fellow radical SF author Terry Bisson. This stimulating little chapbook would work very well as a basis for classroom debate on speculative fiction, history, or the notion of free will. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hagist reevaluat[es] the sources and evidence of the wartime experiences of Hillard&#x2019;s men. . . . It&#x2019;s long overdue.&#x201d;&#x2014;Maureen Taylor, author of <i>The Last Muster: Images of the Revolutionary War Generation</i><br> During the Civil War that threatened to tear the United States apart came the realization that only a handful of veterans of the American Revolution still survived&#x2014;men who had fought the war that created the nation. Six of these men were photographed and interviewed for a book by Reverend E. B. Hillard that appeared late in 1864. Their images have captivated generations since then; but&#x2014;through a combination of faded memories and the interviewer&#x2019;s patriotic agenda&#x2014;the biographies accompanying these amazing photographs were garbled and distorted, containing information that ranged from inaccurate to implausible. Now for the first time the military careers of these men have been researched in detail using a wide range of primary sources. The result is a new perspective on the actual service of these soldiers, from enlistment to discharge, along with new details of their relatively quiet postwar lives. <i>The Revolution&#x2019;s Last Men</i> presents the original biographical interviews published in 1864, pension depositions and other first-hand accounts given by each man later in life, and an up-to-date biography examining each soldier&#x2019;s service and discussing the inaccuracies and uncertainties of the previously published accounts. To complement the photographs taken in 1864, original drawings depict the men as they may have appeared when they were soldiers, using current research on military artifacts and material culture. Also included are additional photographs of some of the men that were not part of the 1864 collection but taken when their status as the last known survivors of the American Revolution made them celebrities. While the photographs of these aged veterans continue to inspire, this book puts their service into perspective and allows these men to be appreciated for who they really were and for their great and unique service to their country.</p><p>DON N.

Dana Schutz plumbs the depths of humor and horror, fantasy and reality in her colorful, expressive paintings. This exhibition catalog features paintings and drawings created by Schutz since 2001. Each of her wildly inventive series is represented, beginning with Frank as a Proboscis Monkey, which wittily depicts the last man on earth, to her current Verb paintings, in which a woman attempts to perform three incongruous activities at once. Schutz&#x2019;s commentary on twenty-firstcentury politics, celebrity, religion, and mores is both absurdist and prescient. Her works are splashed with vibrant color and enriched with tactile brushwork. Schutz combines traditional technique with innovative content to create ambitious, idiosyncratic paintings for our anxious age. Schutz is the<br>recipient of the 2011 Roy R.

He moved through the Middle East for six months, from ISIS-occupied Iraq through Kuwait and along the jagged coastlines of the Emirates and Oman; across a civil-war-torn Yemen and on to Saudia Arabia, Jordan, and Israel, before ending on the shores of the Mediterranean in Lebanon. Like his predecessors, Wood travelled through some of the harshest and most beautiful environments on earth, seeking to challenge our perceptions of this often-misunderstood part of the world. Through the relationships he forges along the way&#x2015;and the personal histories and local mythologies that his companions share&#x2015;Wood examines how the region has changed over thousands of years and reveals a side of the Middle East we don&#x2019;t often see in the media.<br><br></p><p>At once a thrilling personal journey and a skillful piece of cultural reportage, <i>Arabia</i> is a breathtaking chronicle of an epic journey through the land at the root of all civilization.</p></p><p><b>Levison Wood</b> is a writer, photographer, and explorer.

The greatest value to the American reader of this book, however, may be the unbiased observations by this perceptive Brit of the impact which the present United States&#x2019; immigration policy has upon the vast region stretching from South America to our Southern border... Wood&#x2019;s interactions with both notorious MS-13 gang members and innocent families trying to enter our country illustrate the chaos caused by our present system. While he hearkens back to the classic British explorers of our planet, Wood&#x2019;s travels are as current as today&#x2019;s headlines.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Lincoln Journal-Star</b><br></p><p>&#x201c;So often books on great treks seem to relish recounting only maladies, sexcapades, or drunken capers.

So in our current cultural climate of soft footings and cracking walls, Paul's unambiguous commitment to the church as "the pillar and foundation of the truth" is a timely metaphor. The apostle calls us to reconsider the architecture of a truly Christian worldview and to reexamine the gospel and tradition we have inherited. In the letters to Timothy and Titus, Paul focuses on the idea of inheritance. The faithful, he writes, must guard and deliver the inheritance of gospel truth. Nearing the end of his life, Paul is intent on securing the heritage of gospel truth for the next generation. In this Bible Speaks Today volume (previously released as a hardcover book with the title <em>Guard the Truth</em>), John Stott finds in 1 Timothy and Titus a dynamic truth that orders Christian life in the church, the family and the world. Here is the lucid commentary we have come to expect from Stott, ever faithful to the text and time of Paul's letters. But in a manner unique to Stott's role as a distinguished Christian statesman, this work's interpretive and pastoral voice remarkably echoes Paul for our own day. One generation speaks to another: "Guard the truth."</p><p>John R. W. Stott (1921-2011) has been known worldwide as a preacher, evangelist and communicator of Scripture. For many years he served as rector of All Souls Church in London, where he carried out an effective urban pastoral ministry. A leader among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and around the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark Lausanne Covenant (1974). His many books have sold millions of copies around the world and in dozens of languages. Stott's best-known work, <em>Basic Christianity,</em> has sold two million copies and has been translated into more than 60 languages. Other titles include <em>The Cross of Christ, Understanding the Bible, The Contemporary Christian, Evangelical Truth, Issues Facing Christians Today, The Incomparable Christ, Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>Through the Bible Through the Year,</em> a daily devotional. He has also written eight volumes in <em>The Bible Speaks Today</em> series of New Testament expositions. Whether in the West or in the Two-Thirds World, a hallmark of Stott's ministry has been expository preaching that addresses the hearts and minds of contemporary men and women. Stott was honored by <em>Time</em> magazine in 2005 as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World" and was named in the Queen?s New Years Honours list as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969, Stott founded the Langham Trust to fund scholarships for young evangelical leaders from the Majority World. He then founded the Evangelical Literature Trust, which provided books for students, pastors and theological libraries in the Majority World. These two trusts continued as independent charities until 2001, when they were joined as a single charity: the Langham Partnership. Langham's vision continues today to see churches in the Majority World equipped for mission and growing to maturity in Christ through nurturing national movements for biblical preaching, fostering the creation and distribution of evangelical literature, and enhancing evangelical theological education.</p><h2>Conspiracy to Murder: The Rwandan Genocide</h2><p>In April 1994 up to a million people were slaughtered in Rwanda during a murderous campaign of horrifying efficiency.The ferocity of the killing and the cruelty inflicted on defenceless people has no comparison in modern times.<br><br><i>Conspiracy to Murder</i> is the story of how that genocide was planned. It reveals how, from as early as 1990, the political, military and administrative leadership of Rwanda became involved in planning the complete extermination of the Tutsi population. A vicious hate campaign filled the media, urging Hutus to kill; a network of roadblocks was devised to prevent any escape; civil-defence groups were established throughout the country, with eventually every third Hutu being armed; half a million machetes and other agricultural tools were imported, and 85 tons of munitions were distributed country-wide, in the year leading up to the genocide.<br><br>In an outstanding example of investigative journalism, Linda Melvern reveals the full story behind the conspiracy, detailing the involvement of world governments whose responses ranged from complicity to apathy. She shows how the killers outmanoeuvred the Security Council and led UN peacekeepers into a steady trap; how the French military trained the killers and how their &#x2018;humanitarian intervention&#x2019; in June 1994 enabled many of those killers to escape justice; how the JOhn Major government ignored warnings and then proceeded to mislead the British Parliament about what was really happening; how the US is still withholding wiretap and satellite evidence showing that the genocide had begun; and how significant was the knowledge of then Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p><p><b>Linda Melvern</b> is a widely published investigative journalist. She is an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and was a consultant to the Military One prosecution team at the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda. Her previous books include <i>The Ultimate Crime</i> and <i>A People Betrayed</i>.&#x201c;Linda Melvern&#x2019;s work on Rwanda is in the finest traditions of investigative journalism. <i>Conspiracy to Murder: The Rwandan Genocide</i> extends her previous book, <i>A People Betrayed: the Role of the West in Rwanda&#x2019;s Genocide</i>, a brilliant investigation into the tragedy for which the &#x2018;international community&#x2019; was itself responsible. With testimony from witnesses and access to documents previously unseen, she tells an epic and shaming story of culpability and missed opportunities.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Pilger</p><h2>The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Volume 12: Herbarium of the Lewis and Clark Expedition</h2><p>The University of Nebraska Press editions of <i>The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition</i> are widely heralded as a lasting achievement. In all, twelve volumes and a comprehensive index are projected, which together will provide a complete record of the expedition.&nbsp;Volume 12 contains the most complete listing of the plant specimens cataloged by the Lewis and Clark expedition. All but one of the plants were collected by Meriwether Lewis, the most skilled botanist among the expedition&#x2019;s members. The collection, however, was nearly lost over the years due to its scattering among various botanists who intended to catalog the expedition&#x2019;s scientific discoveries. Fortunately, for many years the specimens have been in the care of major institutions, principally the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The 239 extant items are brought together here for the first time. This invaluable volume will assist researchers and enthusiasts hoping to identify each plant&#x2019;s location, distribution, and use along the expedition&#x2019;s route.</p><p>Gary E.

His credentials included: Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic, Designated Mechanic Examiner, Commercial Pilot, Flight Instructor (airplanes), and Advanced and Instrument Ground Instructor. Dale began his career in the U.S. Navy as a mechanic and flight engineer in PBYs. After World War II, he attended Parks Air College. After college, he worked as an instrument overhaul mechanic, instrument shop manager, and flight test instrumentation engineer. He spent the following 16 years as an instructor, and then became director of an aviation maintenance school. Dale was active as a writer of aviation technical materials, and a consultant in developing aviation training programs.

Now in an expanded edition that includes biographies of the generals of Stalingrad and a new chapter on the panzer commanders, this book offers rare insight into the men who ran Nazi Germany&#x2019;s war machine. Going beyond common stereotypes, Samuel W. Mitcham and Gene Mueller recount the compelling lives of a varied group of army, navy, Luftwaffe, and SS men, including their early life, their military exploits during the war, and their post-war career, if any.

Gene Mueller (retired) was professor of history at Lewis &amp; Clark University, Henderson State University, and Texas A&amp;M.<br>Mitcham and Mueller, retired history professors who both taught at Henderson State University, have put together an encyclopedic collection of brief profiles of the careers of the lesser-known German military men&#x2014;true Nazis, skeptics, and patriotic soldiers who tried to focus on the battlefield and ignore the horrors that Hitler unleashed on Europe. This new edition adds a chapter on the men who led the panzer (tank) troops. Every branch of the German military eventually confronted what one officer called the 'unholy disorder of Hitler&#x2019;s leadership.' The Fuehrer constantly micromanaged his commanders&#x2019; tactics, leaving them hamstrung in pivotal confrontations, like the battle of Stalingrad, one of the most ignominious defeats in military history. Some men followed his dubious commands to the letter; others knew that defying Hitler could cost a man his career if not his life. A sterling introduction for anyone interested in how the men who fought for Hitler ticked., <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>In this book, the distinguished historians Samuel W. Mitcham Jr. and Gene Mueller analyze a selection of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s commanders through a series of concise and insightful biographies.

A unique combination of popular and elite influences, the music of this island nation has fascinated since the golden age of the son -- that New World aural collision of Africa and Europe that made Cuban music the rage in Paris, New York, and Mexico beginning in the 1920s.<p>Originally published in 1946 and never before available in an English translation, Music in Cuba is not only the best and most extensive study of Cuban musical history, it is a work of literature in its own right. Drawing on such primary documents as obscure church circulars, dog-eared musical scores pulled from attics, and the records of the Spanish colonial authorities, Music in Cuba sweeps panoramically from the sixteenth into the twentieth century. Carpentier covers European-style elite Cuban music as well as the popular rural Spanish folk and urban Afro-Cuban music.</p><p>In a substantial introduction based on extensive original research, Timothy Brennan explores Carpentier's career prior to the writing of his novels. Looking especially at Carpentier's work as a music reviewer, radio producer, and musical theorist, Brennan suggests new ways of thinking about the role of Latin American artists in Europe between the wars and about the central place of radio and music-club cultures in the European avant-gardes.</p></p><p>Carpentier was a novelist, classically trained pianist and musicologist, aproducer of avant-garde radio programming, and an influential theorist of politics and literature.<br><br>Timothy Brennan is Associate Professor of English at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.<br><br>ALAN WEST-DUR N is Assistant Professor of Modern Languages at Northeastern University. He is a poet, essayist, and translator of Caribbean authors.Franco-Cuban novelist Carpentier (1904-80) was also a musician, music critic, librettist, and radio show producer, well equipped to handle the primary sources he gathered for his 1946 work. His narrative skills are put to happy use in this first English translation as he traces (and perhaps sometimes imagines) how European, West Indian, and African musical influences shaped a uniquely Cuban sound in religious, popular, dance, and art music. A political thinker, Carpentier uncovered major figures in Cuban music history whom other encyclopedias of the time overlooked. Readers, however, should not rely on this book for an up-to-date account of Cuban music lore but instead treat it as a document of its times from a writer who exiled himself from Cuba until after the Castro revolution. Brennan (cultural studies, comparative literature, and English, Univ. of Minnesota) provides useful annotations when needed as well as an introductory critical essay.

The fifteen essays here collected--several of them previously unpublished--address themselves to facets of the American consciousness and to their expression in literature from the time of the Cambridge Agreement to the Nobel Prize acceptance speeches of Hemingway and Faulkner. A companion volume to Errand into the Wilderness, its general theme is one adumbrated in Mr. Miller&#39;s two-volume masterpiece, The New England Mind--the thrust of civilization into the vast, empty continent and its effect upon Americans&#39; concept of themselves as &#34;nature&#39;s nation.&#34; The essays first concentrate on Puritan covenant theology and its gradual adaptation to changing conditions in America: the decline in zeal for a &#34;Bible commonwealth,&#34; the growth of trade and industy, and the necessity for coexisting with large masses of unchurched people. As the book progresses, the emphasis shifts from religion to the philosophy of nature to the development of an original literature, although Mr. Miller is usually analyzing simultaneously all three aspects of the American quest for self-identity. In the final essays, he shows how the forces that molded the self-conscious articulateness of the early New Englanders still operate in the work of contemporary American writers. The introduction to this collection is by Kenneth Murdock, Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English Literature, Emeritus, Harvard University, who, with Perry Miller and Samuel Eliot Morison, accomplished what has been called &#34;one of the great historical re-evaluations of this generation.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Wayside Tavern</h2><p>The Bull, a wayside tavern, weathers sixteen centuries of British history and its hardy Gilderson family proprietors serve every colorful wayfarer along the way and survive every misfortune, from plagues to Nazis</p><p>Norah Lofts was one of the best-known and best-loved of all historical novelists and many of her books remain in print today.

And from that same life, and those cells, Rebecca Skloot has fashioned in <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> a fascinating and moving story of medicine and family, of how life is sustained in laboratories and in memory. Henrietta Lacks was a mother of five in Baltimore, a poor African American migrant from the tobacco farms of Virginia, who died from a cruelly aggressive cancer at the age of 30 in 1951. A sample of her cancerous tissue, taken without her knowledge or consent, as was the custom then, turned out to provide one of the holy grails of mid-century biology: human cells that could survive--even thrive--in the lab. Known as HeLa cells, their stunning potency gave scientists a building block for countless breakthroughs, beginning with the cure for polio. Meanwhile, Henrietta's family continued to live in poverty and frequently poor health, and their discovery decades later of her unknowing contribution--and her cells' strange survival--left them full of pride, anger, and suspicion. For a decade, Skloot doggedly but compassionately gathered the threads of these stories, slowly gaining the trust of the family while helping them learn the truth about Henrietta, and with their aid she tells a rich and haunting story that asks the questions, Who owns our bodies? And who carries our memories? --<em>Tom Nissley<br><br></em> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Jad Abumrad Reviews <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Jad Abumrad is host and creator of the public radio hit <em>Radiolab</em>, now in its seventh season and reaching over a million people monthly. <em>Radiolab</em> combines cutting-edge production with a philosophical approach to big ideas in science and beyond, and an inventive method of storytelling. Abumrad has won numerous awards, including a National Headliner Award in Radio and an American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science Journalism Award. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em>:</strong> <br> <p></p> <p>Honestly, I can't imagine a better tale.</p> <p>A detective story that's at once mythically large and painfully intimate.</p> <p>Just the simple facts are hard to believe: that in 1951, a poor black woman named Henrietta Lacks dies of cervical cancer, but pieces of the tumor that killed her--taken without her knowledge or consent--live on, first in one lab, then in hundreds, then thousands, then in giant factories churning out polio vaccines, then aboard rocket ships launched into space. The cells from this one tumor would spawn a multi-billion dollar industry and become a foundation of modern science--leading to breakthroughs in gene mapping, cloning and fertility and helping to discover how viruses work and how cancer develops (among a million other things). All of which is to say: the science end of this story is enough to blow one's mind right out of one's face.</p> <p>But what's truly remarkable about Rebecca Skloot's book is that we also get the rest of the story, the part that could have easily remained hidden had she not spent ten years unearthing it: Who was Henrietta Lacks? How did she live? How she did die? Did her family know that she'd become, in some sense, immortal, and how did that affect them? These are crucial questions, because science should never forget the people who gave it life. And so, what unfolds is not only a reporting tour de force but also a very entertaining account of Henrietta, her ancestors, her cells and the scientists who grew them.</p> <p>The book ultimately channels its journey of discovery though Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, who never knew her mother, and who dreamt of one day being a scientist.</p> <p>As Deborah Lacks and Skloot search for answers, we're bounced effortlessly from the tiny tobacco-farming Virginia hamlet of Henrietta's childhood to modern-day Baltimore, where Henrietta's family remains. Along the way, a series of unforgettable juxtapositions: cell culturing bumps into faith healings, cutting edge medicine collides with the dark truth that Henrietta's family can't afford the health insurance to care for diseases their mother's cells have helped to cure.</p> <p>Rebecca Skloot tells the story with great sensitivity, urgency and, in the end, damn fine writing. I highly recommend this book. <em>--Jad Abumrad</em></p> <strong>Look Inside <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em></strong> <p></p> <p><strong>Click on thumbnails for larger images</strong></p> <strong></strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Henrietta and David Lacks, circa 1945.</td> <td>Elsie Lacks, Henrietta&#x2019;s older daughter, about five years before she was committed to Crownsville State Hospital, with a diagnosis of &#x201c;idiocy.&#x201d;</td> <td>Deborah Lacks at about age four.</td> <td>The home-house where Henrietta was raised, a four-room log cabin in Clover, Virginia, that once served as slave quarters.

Esther&#x2019;s father is agoraphobic and hasn&#x2019;t left the basement in six years, her twin brother can&#x2019;t be in the dark without a light on, and her mother is terrified of bad luck.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Solars are consumed by their fears and, according to the legend of the curse, destined to die from them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Esther doesn&#x2019;t know what her great fear is yet (nor does she want to), a feat achieved by avoiding pretty much everything. Elevators, small spaces and crowds are all off-limits. So are haircuts, spiders, dolls, mirrors and three dozen other phobias she keeps a record of in her semi-definitive list of worst nightmares.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Esther is pickpocketed by Jonah Smallwood, an old elementary school classmate. Along with her phone, money and a fruit roll-up she&#x2019;d been saving, Jonah also steals her list of fears. Despite the theft, Esther and Jonah become friends, and he sets a challenge for them: in an effort to break the curse that has crippled her family, they will meet every Sunday of senior year to work their way through the list, facing one terrifying fear at a time, including one that Esther hadn&#x2019;t counted on: love.</p><p>Krystal Sutherland was born and raised in Townsville, Australia&#x2014;an inhospitable land where crocodiles, snakes, and jellyfish are always on the prowl. She grew up living directly across the road from the local library and spent almost every day after school (and weekends, too) having adventures between the pages of books (mainly because it was too dangerous to go outside).<br><br> She moved to Sydney for college (and safety), where she cut her writing teeth as the editor of the student magazine at the University of New South Wales. She kept gathering tales as an exchange student in Hong Kong and as a foreign correspondent in Amsterdam. Her first book, <i>Our Chemical Hearts</i>, was released in 2016, and was published in over twenty countries.<br><br> Her three greatest fears are heights, dark caves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and (perhaps worst of all) frogs.<b>1</b><br> <b>The Boy at the Bus Stop</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>ESTHER SOLAR </b>had been waiting outside Lilac Hill Nursing and Rehabilitation Center for half an hour when she received word that the curse had struck again.<br><br> Rosemary Solar, her mother, explained over the phone that she would no longer, under any circumstances, be able to pick her daughter up. A cat black as night with demon-yellow slits for eyes had been found sitting atop the hood of the family car&#x2014;an omen dark enough to prevent her from driving.<br><br> Esther was unfazed. The spontaneous development of phobias was not a new phenomenon in the Solar family, and so she made her way to the bus stop four blocks from Lilac Hill, her red cape billowing in the evening breeze and drawing a few stares from strangers along the way. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the walk, she thought about who normal people would call in a situation such as this. Her father was still interred in the basement he&#x2019;d confined himself to six years ago, Eugene was AWOL (Esther suspected he&#x2019;d slipped through another gap in reality&#x2014;it happened to Eugene from time to time), and her grandfather no longer possessed the fine motor skills required to operate a vehicle (not to mention that he couldn&#x2019;t remember that she was his granddaughter).<br><br> Basically, Esther had very few people who could bail her out of a crisis.<br><br> The bus stop was empty for a Friday night. Only one other person sat there, a tall black guy dressed like a character from a Wes Anderson movie, complete with lime-green corduroy pants, a suede jacket, and a beret pulled down over his hair. The boy was sobbing quietly, so Esther did what you&#x2019;re supposed to do when a complete stranger is showing too much emotion in your presence&#x2014;she ignored him completely. She sat next to him and took out her tattered copy of <i>The Godfather </i>and tried very hard to concentrate on reading it.<br><br> The lights above them hummed like a wasp&#x2019;s nest, flickering on and off. If Esther had kept her eyes down, the next year of her life would&#x2019;ve turned out quite differently, but she was a Solar, and Solars had a bad habit of sticking their noses where they didn&#x2019;t belong.<br><br> The boy sobbed dramatically. Esther looked up. A bruise was blooming across his cheekbone, plum-dark in the fluorescent light, and blood trickled from a split at his eyebrow. His patterned button up&#x2014;clearly donated to a thrift store sometime in the mid- 1970s&#x2014;was torn at the collar.<br> The boy sobbed again, then peeked sideways at her.<br><br> Esther generally avoided talking to people if it wasn&#x2019;t completely necessary; she sometimes avoided people even when it <i>was </i>completely necessary.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said finally. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Think I got mugged,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;You <i>think</i>?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d; He pointed to the wound at his forehead. &#x201c;Took my phone and wallet though, so think I got mugged.&#x201d;<br><br> And that&#x2019;s when she recognized him. &#x201c;Jonah? Jonah Smallwood?&#x201d;<br><br> The years had changed him, but he still had the same wide eyes, the same strong jaw, the same intense stare he had even when he was a kid. He had more hair now: a shadow of stubble and a full head of thick black hair that sat up in a kind of pompadour style. Esther thought he resembled Finn from <i>The Force Awakens</i>, which was, as far as she was concerned, a very good way to look. He glanced at her, at the Jackson Pollock painting of dark freckles smattered across her face and chest and arms, at the mane of peach red hair that fell past her hips. Trying to place her. &#x201c;How do you know my name?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t remember me?&#x201d;<br><br> They&#x2019;d only been friends for a year, and they&#x2019;d only been eight at the time, but still. Esther felt a twinge of sadness that he&#x2019;d apparently forgotten about her&#x2014;she had certainly not forgotten about him.<br><br> &#x201c;We went to elementary school together,&#x201d; Esther explained. &#x201c;I was in Mrs. Price&#x2019;s class with you. You asked me to be your valentine.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonah had bought her a bag of Sweethearts and crafted a handmade card, on which was a drawing of two fruits and a line that read: <i>We make the perfect pear. </i>Inside, he had asked her to meet him at recess.<br><br> Esther had waited. Jonah hadn&#x2019;t showed. In fact, she&#x2019;d never seen him again.<br><br> Until now.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; Jonah said slowly, recognition finally dawning on his face. &#x201c;I liked you because you protested Dumbledore&#x2019;s death outside the bookstore like a week after the movie came out.&#x201d;<br> How Esther remembered it: little Esther, seven years old with a bright red bowl cut, picketing the local bookstore with a sign that read, SAVE THE WIZARDS. And then a snippet from the six o&#x2019;clock news, a reporter kneeling next to her, asking her the question: &#x201c;You do realize the book was published years ago and the ending can&#x2019;t be changed?&#x201d; and her blinking dumbly into the camera.<br><br> Back to reality: &#x201c;I hate that there&#x2019;s video evidence of that.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonah nodded at her outfit, at the bloodred cape held at her throat by a ribbon and the wicker basket resting at her feet. &#x201c;Looks like you&#x2019;re still strange. Why are you dressed like Red Riding Hood?&#x201d;<br><br> Esther hadn&#x2019;t had to answer questions about her predisposition for costumes for several years. Strangers on the street always assumed she was on her way to or from a costume party. Her teachers&#x2014;much to their vexation&#x2014;could find no fault with her outfits as far as the school&#x2019;s dress code was concerned, and her classmates were used to her coming in dressed as Alice in Wonderland or Bellatrix Lestrange or whatever, and didn&#x2019;t really care what she wore so long as she kept smuggling them cake. (More on this in a moment.)<br><br> &#x201c;I was visiting a grandparent. It seemed appropriate,&#x201d; she said in reply, which appeared to satisfy Jonah, because he nodded like he understood.<br><br> &#x201c;Look, you got any cash on you?&#x201d;<br><br> Esther did have cash on her, in her Little Red Riding Hood picnic basket. She had $55, all of it earmarked for her Get the Hell Out of This Podunk Town fund, which now stood at $2,235 in total. <br> &nbsp;<br> Back to the previously mentioned cake. You see, in Esther&#x2019;s junior year, East River High had instituted sweeping changes in the cafeteria until only healthy food was available. Gone were the pizzas and chicken nuggets and tots and fries and sloppy joes and nachos that made high school semibearable. The words &#x201c;Michelle Obama&#x201d; were now muttered in exasperation every time a new item was added to the menu, like leek and cauliflower soup or steamed broccoli pie. Esther had seen a budding business opportunity and made a box mix of double chocolate fudge brownies. She brought them into school the next day, where she sold each one for five dollars and made a cool profit of fifty bucks. Since then, she&#x2019;d become the Walter White of junk food; such was the extent of her empire that her customers at school had dubbed her &#x201c;Cakenberg.&#x201d;<br><br> She&#x2019;d recently expanded her territory to Lilac Hill Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where the most exciting things on the menu were overcooked hot dog and bland mashed potato. Business was booming.<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Why?</i>&#x201d; she said slowly.<br><br> &#x201c;I need money for a bus fare. You give me cash, and I can use your phone to transfer funds from my bank account directly into yours.&#x201d;<br><br> It sounded slippery as all hell, but Jonah was bruised and bleeding and crying, and she still halfway saw him as the sweet young boy who&#x2019;d once liked her enough to draw her a picture of two pears.<br><br> So Esther said: &#x201c;How much do you need?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How much you got? I&#x2019;ll take it all and transfer you that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have fifty-five dollars.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take fifty-five dollars.&#x201d;<br><br> Jonah stood up and came to sit next to her. He was much taller than she thought, and thinner too, like a stalk of corn. She watched as he opened the banking app on her phone, logged in, filled in her account details as she gave them to him, and authorized the transfer.<br><br> <i>Funds transfer successful, </i>the app read.<br><br> So she leaned down and opened her basket and gave him the fifty-five dollars she&#x2019;d made at Lilac Hill today.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Jonah said as he shook her hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all right, Esther.&#x201d; Then he stood, and winked, and was gone. Again.<br><br> And that&#x2019;s how, on a warm, damp evening at the end of summer, Jonah Smallwood swindled her out of fifty-five dollars and pickpocketed, in the space of approximately four minutes:<br><br> -her grandmother&#x2019;s bracelet, right off her wrist<br> -her iPhone <br> -a Fruit Roll-Up from her basket that she&#x2019;d been saving for the ride home <br> -her library card (which he later used to rack up $19.99 in replacement fees for defacing a copy of <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>with lobster graffiti) <br> -her copy of <i>The Godfather </i><br> -her semi-definitive list of worst nightmares <br> -and her dignity<br><br> Esther kept replaying the cringeworthy memory of her Dumbledore protest in her head, and didn&#x2019;t realize she&#x2019;d been robbed until her bus arrived six minutes and nineteen seconds later, at which point she exclaimed to the driver, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been robbed!&#x201d; To which the driver said, &#x201c;No riffraff!&#x201d; and closed the doors in her face.<br><br> (Perhaps Jonah didn&#x2019;t steal all of her dignity&#x2014;the bus driver took what shreds he hadn&#x2019;t managed to scrape away from her bones.)<br><br> So you see, the story of how Esther Solar was robbed by Jonah Smallwood is quite straightforward. The story of how she came to love Jonah Smallwood is a little bit more complicated.</p><h2>Guilty By Reason of Insanity: Why The Democrats Must Not Win</h2><p><b>"Today&#x2019;s Democrats are pushing policies that are simply insane, and David Limbaugh proves it in his terriffic, and tremendously important, new book, <i>Guilty by Reason of Insanity</i>." &#x2014; MARK LEVIN</b><br> <br> <b>"Few pundits can match David Limbaugh for research, depth of knowledge, and political insight, and in this book, perhaps his best political book, he shows how the Democrat Party has completely lost its mind." &#x2014; SEAN HANNITY</b><br> <br> The left has truly lost its mind.

For poor kids from the housing projects, the future looked bleak. But basketball could provide the quickest ticket out, an opportunity to earn a college scholarship and perhaps even play in the NBA.<br> <br>Dunbar High School had one of the most successful basketball programs, not only in Baltimore but in the entire country, and in the early 1980s, the Dunbar Poets were arguably the best high school team of all time. Four starting players&#x2014;Muggsy Bogues, Reggie Williams, David Wingate, and Reggie Lewis&#x2014;would eventually play in the NBA, an unheard-of success rate. In <i>The Boys of Dunbar</i>, Alejandro Danois takes us through the 1981-1982 season with the Poets as the team conquered all its opponents. But more than that, he takes us into the lives of these kids, and especially of Coach Bob Wade, a former NFL player from the same neighborhood who knew that the basketball court, and the lessons his players would learn there, held the key to the future.<br> <br>Drawing on interviews with Coach Wade, Muggsy Bogues, and others, <i>The Boys of Dunbar</i> is a remarkable testament to the power of dedication, inspiration, and teamwork. It is an ode to an extraordinary coach, a father figure who had lived the life of his players years before and who turned a dream into reality.</p><p>A native of Brooklyn, New York, Alejandro Danois now lives in Baltimore, Maryland. He earned a scholarship for talented minority students to attend Milton Academy in Massachusetts and later attended the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Danois is editor-in-chief of <i>The Shadow League</i> and a freelance sports and entertainment writer whose work has been published by <i>The</i> <i>New York Times, The</i> <i>Baltimore Sun, </i>Associated Press<i>, Bleacher Report, Sporting News, Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>Ebony </i>magazine, among others. <i>The Boys of Dunbar</i> is his first book.The Boys of Dunbar CHAPTER ONE<p></p> &#x201c;Yes I Can!&#x201d;<p></p> <br>AT THE CONCLUSION OF the first varsity basketball practice for Baltimore&#x2019;s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, the young men gathered in the gymnasium were exhausted.<br> <br>They all stood at attention, varying shades of brown faces glistening with perspiration, staring at the bear of a man who&#x2019;d alternated between screams of disgust and soft words of encouragement. They were the chosen ones, the few who had actually realized the dream this early in their lives. Through every summer tournament, winter recreation league game, and one-on-one contest, through every solitary morning sidestepping broken glass and empty liquor bottles, dribbling a ball through imaginary defenders to practice jump shots or master the backboard, the boys&#x2019; goal was the same. Not the NCAA, not the NBA, but suiting up for the only franchise that mattered to them, Dunbar.<br> <br>They yearned to hold aloft the flame of Dunbar basketball excellence. Whatever their drill sergeant of a coach demanded of them, they demanded of one another. The Dunbar tradition was a major source of pride to a large swath of the city of Baltimore. This fact was not lost on any of them.<br> <br>The imposing edifice of Dunbar High School was stuffed tightly amid dreary housing projects and sagging row homes in predominantly black East Baltimore. For all of the drab building&#x2019;s shortcomings, the gymnasium inside was a veritable shrine, a sacrosanct place to the young men now standing on its hardwood floor. Despite their weary muscles, the boys were anxious to get their season under way.<br> <br>For head coach Bob Wade, who was also Dunbar&#x2019;s head varsity football and baseball coach, and returning players like junior All-American Reggie Williams and highly recruited seniors David Wingate and Gary Graham, the disappointment of the previous season&#x2019;s 94&#x2013;91 triple-overtime loss to Calvert Hall, a Catholic school, remained fresh in their minds. It was a contest that many thought was one of the greatest high school games ever played between two Baltimore area schools.<br> <br>Despite the months that had passed and the fresh start that a new season promised, that loss inspired Dunbar from the first whistle of that initial practice. Wade was entering the season with a mind-boggling record of 132&#x2013;10 as Dunbar&#x2019;s head coach, having won five Maryland Scholastic Association titles over the previous six years. But there were many people in the city who questioned his success and the tactics he employed to achieve such a sparkling r�sum�. There were whispers from parents and coaches at other city schools intimating that Wade recruited his players.<br> <br>Three of his team&#x2019;s new starters had transferred from other schools at the beginning of the &#x2019;81&#x2013;&#x2019;82 school year. Some people wanted an investigation and sanctions, referring to Dunbar as &#x201c;the city All-Stars.&#x201d; But the truth, as difficult as it was for some to accept, was that Wade did not need to recruit. Dunbar was the city&#x2019;s marquee public school program, with an astounding talent pool that resided in the surrounding housing projects. Almost every talented kid in the city wanted to play there.<br> <br>&#x201c;I never recruited a player, nor did I have to,&#x201d; said Wade. &#x201c;Dunbar had a tradition of excellence that many kids dreamed of being a part of. That tradition was established long before I ever got there. I was just lucky enough that so many talented kids wanted to be a part of what we were doing.&#x201d; Wade may not have &#x201c;recruited&#x201d; players, but he certainly singled out those youngsters he believed showed the most promise, regardless of their neighborhood or school district.<br> <br>The Poets had lost three games the year before. Wade was more determined than ever that this new squad was going to do better. His challenge every year was to find which buttons to push with certain players; who could accept being yelled at and who needed quiet encouragement. At various points in practice, he joked, he cajoled, and sometimes he yelled and insulted. One minute, he&#x2019;d appear surly, brusque, and dyspeptic, the next solicitous and benevolent. With the talent at his disposal, he drove them mercilessly, determined to make practices so difficult that every game, no matter who they faced, would be a cakewalk. In his eyes, the three losses that they had suffered the year before were three too many.<br> <br>Wade emphasized the game&#x2019;s details, the subtle nuances that many high school kids never learn to master. His practices were filled with hours upon hours of drills that fostered a mastery of things like defensive footwork, swift defensive rotations designed to keep players between the opposing man and the basket, how to take charges, how to set screens, the proper angles to take when rolling off the screen and cutting to the basket, how to box out for rebounds, and how to throw outlet passes, among a plethora of other details that could be the difference between a win or a loss in a close game. Wade ran the same drills over and over again, programming his players to react quickly and correctly to various game situations. The casual fans who packed Dunbar&#x2019;s gym and didn&#x2019;t have an advanced understanding of the game undoubtedly enjoyed the frenetic pace that the Poets played at, the alley-oops, the slam dunks, and the way they ran the ball down an opponent&#x2019;s throat. They might have assumed that his players were just great athletes and that all Wade had to do was roll the ball out and let them run up and down the court. But sophisticated students of the game could see the discipline, how fundamentally sound and unselfish his Dunbar teams were, how they&#x2019;d coalesced as a unit, always seeming to make the right plays by instantaneously adjusting.<br> <br>Wade&#x2019;s other obsession was academics. From the mandatory study halls that were required for his players year-round, even when their sport was out of season, to the teachers he convinced to give up a slice of their free time to volunteer as tutors, Wade&#x2019;s commitment to his athletes&#x2019; classroom responsibilities was unquestioned. If a star player needed help, Wade had a support infrastructure in place. He&#x2019;d make sure his kids worked in the classroom because he knew that one day the balls would stop bouncing. If a star player failed, there were no special provisions or demands on teachers to let his boys slide by for the sake of athletic victories. If they couldn&#x2019;t handle their responsibilities in school, they simply couldn&#x2019;t play for him.<br> <br>Wade also had another mechanism in place that allowed him to keep tabs on his players outside of the school: the neighborhood grapevine. He&#x2019;d walked the same streets during his youth, knew the neighborhood inside and out, and had a network of informants, from law enforcement personnel like his good friend Marshall Goodwin, who worked as an officer with the city&#x2019;s sheriff&#x2019;s department and served as the team&#x2019;s de facto bodyguard, to folks involved in the less desirable elements of the underground economy. Having grown up in the area, he was well respected, even by the criminal element. Despite their illegal activities, even the drug dealers operated by a tacit code in East Baltimore: Bob Wade&#x2019;s Dunbar Poets were off-limits.<br> <br>But the city&#x2019;s drug trade was metastasizing into something far more malignant; its victims were being snared at an earlier age than ever before. When Wade was a teenager, the heroin trade, with its scarce supply and great demand, was run by old-school traffickers whose inventories were, in effect, &#x201c;regulated.&#x201d; These were people who saw themselves as businessmen, who kept their circles small. It was a matter of ethics for them to keep the trade away from the street corners and the neighborhood children. Their drugs were processed in safe houses and later distributed through bars, pool halls, and nightclubs, or delivered to individual customers in their apartments or private homes. They had a conservative, long-term approach to their business philosophies.<br> <br>The old-school kingpins had enduring links to small local businesses through legitimate investments and loans, where they effectively washed their money. They nurtured community support by giving away Thanksgiving meals to needy families, purchasing and having groceries delivered to the elderly, sponsoring bus trips to local amusement parks and neighborhood block parties and picnics. But the demarcation of keeping kids away from the narcotics trade was crossed in the late 1970s when a new breed of kingpin emerged and changed the business model in favor of swelling profit margins. The drugs moved out of the nightclub scene and into open-air markets. But perhaps their most treacherous attempt at modernization was the recruitment of kids to join the expanding workforce. And among the prime recruiting targets were the teenagers in the Lafayette Courts housing projects, where many of Wade&#x2019;s players had resided over the years.<br> <br>When Wade was coaching in the early 1980s, cocaine experienced a phenomenal growth in popularity on the already battered streets of urban America. With the bountiful supply of cocaine available, enterprising teens began setting up their own shops, running back and forth via Greyhound bus or Amtrak trains to Upper Manhattan&#x2019;s Washington Heights neighborhood, where they could buy unlimited supplies of high-grade cocaine at wholesale prices. As the adolescent army and new breed of drug dealer flourished, they proved to be wantonly reckless and indiscriminately violent in settling turf wars with rival dealers for the prime drug market corners.<br> <br>In addition to their fancy clothes, flashy cars, and sparkling jewelry, they also owned a stupefying amount of high-powered semiautomatic weapons. Where the teen gangs of Wade&#x2019;s East Baltimore were fighting with their hands or knives to settle who the toughest crew was, the teen gangs of East Baltimore in the 1980s were fighting with deadly assault weapons to control the multimillion-dollar narcotics trade. And the body count was becoming increasingly filled with innocent children and working folks who happened to get caught in the crossfire.<br> <br>&#x201c;The drug culture in Baltimore underwent a significant change with the emergence of a dealer by the name of Maurice &#x2018;Peanut&#x2019; King in the late 1970s, whose rise was precipitated by a joint federal and city law enforcement task force that basically took down the older, major heroin dealers, one by one,&#x201d; said Sunni Khalid, a former crime reporter for the Baltimore Sun. &#x201c;They thought they&#x2019;d be able to dry up the market for heroin, but I-95, which ran right through the heart of Baltimore, was the East Coast&#x2019;s main drug corridor, and Peanut King simply filled the vacuum. But he changed the dynamic of the city&#x2019;s drug business philosophy because he took advantage of Maryland&#x2019;s lax juvenile justice system, employing teenagers to sell his drugs.<br> <br>&#x201c;This was at a time when Baltimore was deindustrializing. East Baltimore was a collection of blue-collar neighborhoods from the 1920s through the late 1970s and early &#x2019;80s, but when the shipyards and steelyards started closing down, the neighborhoods and schools started falling into disrepair. These teenage drug dealers became their family&#x2019;s main wage earners. The proximity of the drugs drew closer to the schools and as cocaine moved in, you had guys like Peanut King reconfiguring the old drug territories, giving the responsibility on the retail level to this army of young, undisciplined, and uneducated kids. As the years progressed, the drug dealers became younger and younger.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Eastern District used to be the smallest of the city&#x2019;s nine police districts, only 3.1 square miles, but they started experiencing the highest number of drug-related shootings. The dealers were fighting for territories, and they were arming themselves with arsenals. AK-47 assault rifles started showing up on the streets, as did bulletproof vests. The open-air drug markets opened in the early 1980s and stayed open for business, twenty-four hours a day, for close to twenty years. So you had this erosion of respect for elders and any type of authority figures. The effects devastated the community, and the incarceration rates skyrocketed. The mothers, once the strength of the family unit, were now out in the streets chasing the cocaine and crack high.<br> <br>&#x201c;The local economy had broken down, the neighborhoods were being transformed for the worse, the good jobs dried up, and family units and schools broke down. It was all such a vicious cycle.&#x201d;<br> <br>But while the street culture and mentality of the community were changing, Wade remained rigid in his adherence to old-school principles. One thing he would not tolerate on the basketball court was showboating. No one was ever allowed, after a great play or a victory, to thrust his pointer finger in the air, signifying that he was number one. The Poets were inculcated with the philosophy that to disrespect one&#x2019;s opponent was disrespectful to the game itself. If a player threw a behind-the-back pass where a simple chest or bounce pass would have sufficed, he found himself sitting on the bench shortly thereafter.<br> <br>When the final school bell rang on that late autumn afternoon in 1981, the Dunbar players made their way to study hall. At exactly 3:30 p.m., study hall commenced, and the only sounds to be heard were the opening and closing of textbooks, the whirring of the ventilation system, and snippets of conversation from the adjacent corridors and stairwell.<br> <br>Before anyone could practice, he was required to complete every homework assignment due the next day. Wade set no specified time to start practice; it came after study hall. Only after the homework was reviewed by one of the teachers who volunteered as tutors could players go to the gym. Practice began when the last textbook was closed.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are certain expectations that are placed on you as a player who wears the Dunbar uniform,&#x201d; Wade said, launching into his standard speech before commencing the inaugural practice of each season. &#x201c;You should have been working out on your own, and if you haven&#x2019;t, we&#x2019;ll soon find out. It&#x2019;s not going to be easy. Because of who we are, there is a target that will always be on your back. In order to deal with that, day in and day out, we will go that extra mile. No one will be more prepared and in better condition than we will. No one has invented a pill that you can swallow to get you in the kind of shape that you need to be in. It starts right here.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spoke as if he were reciting items on a grocery list, but Wade was still burning on the inside at how the previous season had ended. He was eager to begin again. Although there were many recent additions to the team and personalities that needed to be incorporated into his system, he liked what he saw early on. This team had size, speed, and quickness. They were tough and looked hungry.<br> <br>He blew his whistle, and the players strapped on the sand-filled backpacks that sat at their feet. They then scooped up two bricks, one for each hand, and a seemingly endless number of full-court sprints followed. Then, to half-court and back followed by suicide runs&#x2014;sprints to the nearest free-throw line and back to the baseline, followed immediately by a sprint to the half-court line and back to the baseline, with an ensuing sprint to the free-throw line at the other end of the court and back to the baseline, concluded by a full-court dash to the far baseline and back.<br> <br>The players were then separated into small groups and instructed to continuously jump as high as they could, with the bricks extended over their heads, up and down and up an...</p><h2>Thea Porter&#39;s Scrapbook</h2><p>Starting in 1966, Thea Porter designed clothes for the rich and famous for nearly two decades.&nbsp;Her creations were made from sumptuous fabrics that drew inspiration from the Middle East, combining richly patterned silks with antique fabrics.

In these volumes the word is personified in the woman Yael, silence in her still-born child Elya. Even though words imply ambiguity and lies, they are the home of the exile. A book becomes the Book, fragments of the law that are in some way unified, where past and present, the visionary, and the common place, encounter each other. For Jabes every word is a question in the book of being. Man defines himself in the world against all that threatens his existence- death, the infinite, silence, that is, God, his primal opponent.

Without a deeper understanding of the philosophy that spawned it, the Tai-Chi is incomplete, merely a series of exercises to be memorized and performed. Here you'll find a thorough discussion of Wu Chi, the Yin or female counterpart to Tai-Chi's male or physical energy, which together make up the Tao (the Way), the totality of all things. Literally translated as the "Ancient Beginning," Wu Chi relates to the spiritual in the way that Tai-Chi does the physical. Only by truly understanding and embracing this duality can one's soul be fully developed and the resulting strength, serenity, and clarity of mind woven into your daily living.<br></p><p>Raised in Texas, John Lash has studied and practised Tai Chi for over thirty years and has a masters degree in Philosophy.

With a wide range of media, Kelley&#39;s work explores themes as varied as post-punk politics, religious systems, social class, and repressed memory. Using architectural models to represent schools he attended, his 1995 work, Educational Complex, presents forgotten spaces as frames for private trauma, real or imagined. The work&#39;s implications are at once miniature and massive. In this book, John Miller offers an illustrated examination of this milestone work that marked a significant change in Kelley&#39;s practice. A &#34;complex&#34; can mean an architectural configuration, a psychological syndrome, or a political apparatus, and Miller approaches Educational Complex through corresponding lines of inquiry, considering the making of the work, examining it in terms of education and trauma (sexual or otherwise), and investigating how it tests the ideological horizon of art as an institution. Miller shows that in Educational Complex, Kelley expands his political and aesthetic focus, including not only such artifacts as generic forms of architecture but (inspired by the infamous McMartin Preschool case) popular fantasies associated with ritual sex abuse and false memory syndrome. Through this archaeology of the contemporary, Miller argues, Kelley examines the mandate for education and the liberal democratic premises underpinning it.</p><p><p>John Miller, Professor of Professional Practice in the Department of Art History at Barnard College, is an artist and critic whose work has been exhibited internationally.

With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Pamela Anderson and literary Jesus freaks. And don't even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. <p> Whether deconstructing Saved by the Bell episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of The Empire Strikes Back or the Celtics/ Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he'll make you laugh, and he'll drive you insane -- usually all at once. <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i> is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, and politics but -- really -- it's about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, "In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever 'in and of itself.'"</p></p><p>There's quite a bit of intelligent analysis and thought-provoking insight packed into the pages of Chuck Klosterman's <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i>, which is a little surprising considering how darn stupid most of Klosterman's subject matter actually is. Klosterman, one of the few members of the so-called "Generation X" to proudly embrace that label and the stereotypical image of disaffected slackers that often accompanies it, takes the reader on a witty and highly entertaining tour through portions of pop culture not usually subjected to analysis and presents his thoughts on <i>Saved by the Bell</i>, Billy Joel, amateur porn, MTV's <i>The Real World</i>, and much more. It would be easy in dealing with such subject matter to simply pile on some undergraduate level deconstruction, make a few jokes, and have yourself a clever little book. But Klosterman goes deeper than that, often employing his own life spent as a member of the lowbrow target demographic to measure the cultural impact of his subjects. While the book never quite lives up to the use of the word "manifesto" in the title (it's really more of a survey mixed with elements of memoir), there is much here to entertain and illuminate, particularly passages on the psychoses and motivations of breakfast cereal mascots, the difference between Celtic fans and Laker fans, and <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. Sections on a Guns n' Roses tribute band, <i>The Sims</i>, and soccer feel more like magazine pieces included to fill space than part of a cohesive whole. But when you're talking about a book based on a section of cultural history so reliant on a lack of attention span, even the incongruities feel somehow appropriate. <i>--John Moe</i>Chuck Klosterman is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Eating the Dinosaur</i>; <i>Downtown Owl</i>; <i>Chuck Klosterman IV</i>; <i>Killing Yourself to Live</i>; <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i>; and <i>Fargo Rock City</i>, winner of the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award.

Wood argues that the emergence of the peasant as citizen, juridically and politically independent, accounts for much that is remarkable in Athenian political institutions and culture. <br><br> From a survey of historical writings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the focus of which distorted later debates, Wood goes on to take issue with influential arguments, such as those of G.E.M. de Ste Croix, about the importance of slavery in agricultural production. The social, political and cultural influence of the peasant-citizen is explored in a way which questions some of the most cherished conventions of Marxist and non-Marxist historiography.</p><p><b>Ellen Meiksins Wood,</b> for many years Professor of Political Science at York University, Toronto, is the author of many books, including <i>Democracy Against Capitalism </i>and, with Verso, <i>The Pristine Culture of Capitalism, The Origin of Capitalism, Peasant-Citizen and Slave, Citizens to Lords,</i> <i>Empire of Capital </i>and <i>Liberty and Property</i>.&#x201c;Learned, elegantly argued and, I think, important ...

The author explains every aspect of the holiday; from the way the house is cleaned and prepared, to setting the Seder table, the order of the service, selected recipes, table decorations, and the meanings of the prayers. Traditional prayers in Hebrew, English translation, and transliteration as well as verse sung to familiar tunes such as Sing a Song of Sixpence have a place in this Haggadah. Stories, poems, songs, and music, a play about the Exodus and discussion questions help children and adults explore the meaning of Passover. Customs from different parts of the world and gender-neutral translations of the Hebrew text make the book accessible to people of varied backgrounds. Adults are the likely users; dipping into it to understand various aspects of the holiday celebration; reading passages aloud; selecting portions for the family Seder. Children will love the illustrations. A beautifully designed resource with a wealth of material for the family that wants to construct its own child-centered Passover celebration. (Nonfiction. All ages) -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Teaming their considerable talents, Musleah and August offer a stop-and-take-notice version of the book used to lead families through the seder, the home service, and the festive meal that opens the eight-day Passover celebration. Subtle reminders of the holiday's celebration of freedom are enfolded into Musleah's poetic explanations of the symbolic foods and traditions, as well as questions that encourage participation in the celebration. The Hebrew prayers are gender neutral and written with transliterations and English translations so everyone can be involved in the service. The scores and lyrics of traditional songs, as well as illuminating comments about their meanings, are included, and songs set to melodies such as "Yankee Doodle," add a lighthearted touch for children. There are also folk stories and a brief, four-act play. August's jubilant, signature linocuts, printed in oils on rice paper, bloom in the colors and stylized images of spring and the Middle East's flowers and fruits. Their luminous colors and rich textures lend a radiance to the majestic depiction of the seder plate and wrap the images of God's intervention to free the Israelites in spirituality. The vibrant writing and artistic creativity of this memorable collaboration vitalize an ancient Jewish tradition for contemporary children. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>Susan Sontag: Later Essays (LOA #292): Under the Sign of Saturn / AIDS and its Metaphors / Where the Stress Falls / Regarding the Pain of Others / At ...

This second volume in&nbsp;Library of America's definitive Sontag edition gathers all the collected essays and&nbsp;speeches from her last quarter-century, brilliant works whose subjects, from the&nbsp;AIDS epidemic, 9/11, the Iraq war, and the perverse allure of Fascism to painting,&nbsp;dance, music, film, and scintillating literary portraits of such writers as Walter&nbsp;Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Machado de Assis, Jorge Luis Borges,&nbsp;Nadine Gordimer, Joseph Brodsky, W.

Chesterton called <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> "a very melodramatic sort of moonshine." Set in a phantasmagoric London where policemen are poets and anarchists camouflage themselves as, well, anarchists, his 1907 novel offers up one highly colored enigma after another. If that weren't enough, the author also throws in an elephant chase and a hot-air-balloon pursuit in which the pursuers suffer from "the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon." <p> But Chesterton is also concerned with more serious questions of honor and truth (and less serious ones, perhaps, of duels and dualism). Our hero is Gabriel Syme, a policeman who cannot reveal that his fellow poet Lucian Gregory is an anarchist. In Chesterton's agile, antic hands, Syme is the virtual embodiment of paradox: </p><blockquote> He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art and self-realization; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinthe and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.... Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing left--sanity. </blockquote> Elected undercover into the Central European Council of anarchists, Syme must avoid discovery <i>and</i> save the world from any bombings in the offing. As Thursday (each anarchist takes the name of a weekday--the only quotidian thing about this fantasia) does his best to undo his new colleagues, the masks multiply. The question then becomes: Do they reveal or conceal? And who, not to mention what, can be believed? As <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> proceeds, it becomes a hilarious numbers game with a more serious undertone--what happens if most members of the council actually turn out to be on the side of right? Chesterton's tour de force is a thriller that is best read slowly, so as to savor his highly anarchic take on anarchy. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>G. K. Chesterton&#39;s surreal masterpiece is a psychological thriller that centers on seven anarchists in turn-of-the-century London who call themselves by the names of the days of the week. Chesterton explores the meanings of their disguised identities in what is a fascinating mystery and, ultimately, a spellbinding allegory. As Jonathan Lethem remarks in his Introduction, The real characters are the ideas. Chesterton&#39;s nutty agenda is really quite simple: to expose moral relativism and parlor nihilism for the devils he believes them to be. This wouldn&#39;t be interesting at all, though, if he didn&#39;t also show such passion for giving the devil his due. He animates the forces of chaos and anarchy with every ounce of imaginative verve and rhetorical force in his body.</p><h2>The Love-charm of Bombs: Restless Lives in the Second World War</h2><p><p><i>'The nightly routine of sirens, barrage, the probing raider, the unmistakable engine ... the bomb-bursts moving nearer and then moving away, hold one like a love-charm' </i>--<b>Graham Greene</b></p><p>When the first bombs fell on London in August 1940, the city was transformed overnight into a strange kind of battlefield. For most Londoners, the sirens, guns, planes, and bombs brought sleepless nights, fear and loss. But for a group of writers, the war became an incomparably vivid source of inspiration, the blazing streets scenes of exhilaration in which fear could transmute into love. In this powerful chronicle of literary life under the Blitz, Lara Feigel vividly conjures the lives of five prominent writers: Elizabeth Bowen, Graham Greene, Rose Macaulay, Hilde Spiel and the novelist Henry Green. Starting with a sparklingly detailed recreation of a single night of September 1940, the narrative traces the tempestuous experiences of these five figures through five years in London and Ireland, followed by postwar Vienna and Berlin.</p><p>Volunteering to drive ambulances, patrol the streets and fight fires, the protagonists all exhibited a unified spirit of a nation under siege, but as individuals their emotions were more volatile. As the sky whistled and the ground shook, nerves were tested, loyalties examined and torrid affairs undertaken. Literary historian and journalist Feigel brilliantly and beautifully interweaves the letters, diaries, journalism and fiction of her writers with official records to chart the history of a burning world, experienced through the eyes of extraordinary individuals.</p></p><p>Lara Feigel is Lecturer in English and the Medical Humanities at King's College, London, where her research is centered on the 1930s and the Second World War.

It happened in real life, too, as Feigel makes clear in this fascinating group biography of five English writers who spent the blitz years fighting fires, driving ambulances, serving as air wardens, and, above all, making love, usually in illicit relationships. From late 1940 into 1941, when the bombs were at their most terrifying, Graham Greene, Elizabeth Bowen, Rose Macaulay, Henry Green, and Hilde Spiel risked their lives in relief work while engaging in life-defining love affairs. Clocks tended to stop when bombs exploded nearby, Feigel notes, &#x201c;and the suspended present created a climate where intense emotions could flourish.&#x201d; Or, as a character in Henry Green&#x2019;s Caught puts it, &#x201c;War . . . was sex.&#x201d; Of course, it was more than that, and if, at times, these writers&#x2019; obsessive focus on their erotic lives seems a little myopic, that&#x2019;s the point: how the intensity of life during the blitz translated inevitably into a craving for human connectedness. Though the latter portions of the book, which follow the writers&#x2019; postwar lives, seem anticlimactic, this is a compelling study of an endlessly fascinating moment in world history. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Master of the Lotus Garden: The Life and Art of Bada Shanren (1626-1705)</h2><p>Bada Shanren created one of the most compelling and distinctive bodies of graphic art in the history of Chinese culture. A prince of the Ming imperial family, he became a Buddhist monk after the Manchu invasion of China led to the collapse of the Ming dynasty. Thirty years later, when the turmoil of the conquest had passed, he returned to secular life as a painter, poet, and calligrapher. Although portrayed by his contemporaries as a mad eccentric, his art reveals a rational genius, and evidence suggests that he feigned madness to conceal his inner emotions. Despite his enigmatic character, he has had a profound influence on later generations of Chinese artists, especially those of the 20th century. This book provides an analysis of the life and art of Bada Shanren. The authors give an historical overview of the period in which Bada Shanren lived, discuss his importance in Chinese art history as the consummate scholar artist, and provide a comprehensive biography that discusses his genealogy, education, activities, friends, and development as an artist. More than 400 of Bada Shanren&#39;s works are reproduced and 70 representative paintings and works of calligraphy are accompanied by interpretive essays. There are also translations of poems and inscriptions, most of which have not been previously published.</p><p></p><h2>Winter Solstice</h2><p>Elfrida Phipps loves her new life in the pretty Hampshire village. She has a tiny cottage, her faithful dog Horace and the friendship of the neighbouring Blundells - particularly Oscar - to ensure that her days include companionship as well as independence. But an unforeseen tragedy upsets Elfrida&#39;s tranquillity: Oscar&#39;s wife and daughter are killed in a terrible car crash and he finds himself homeless when his stepchildren claim their dead mother&#39;s inheritance. Oscar and Elfrida take refuge in a rambling house in Scotland which becomes a magnet for various waifs and strays who converge upon it, including an unhappy teenage girl. It could be a recipe for disaster. But somehow the Christmas season weaves its magical spell and for Elfrida and Oscar, in the evening of their lives, the winter solstice brings love and solace.</p><p>Rosamunde Pilcher's novel, despite its chilly setting, will warm the hearts of her growing army of loyal fans. <i>Winter Solstice</i> has all the familiar trademarks of a Pilcher saga, spun in her inimitable, homey, beguiling style. The story is told, chapter by chapter, from the perspectives of an eclectic array of characters. Former actress Elfrida--not very good by her own admission--leaves London for a geriatric bolthole in the country where she meets retired schoolmaster and organist, Oscar. Meanwhile, Carrie (Elfrida's second cousin), returns to London from Austria where she had a brilliant career in the tourist industry, only to find her niece, 14-year-old Lucy, sadly neglected by her selfish mother and equally spoiled grandmother. Finally, handsome Sam is recalled from New York by his company chairman to revive an ailing Scottish textile mill. <p> As one character after another must learn to live with their losses, they find themselves collectively spirited northwards, from Sussex to Scotland, by way of Cornwall. And, as events unfurl, slowly, surely, but inevitably, those in need find solace in unexpected places. While her characterizations are generally carefully crafted and entirely rounded, Pilcher's greatest strengths lie in her natural, easy narratives of everyday life and her thoroughly researched and captivating descriptions of scenery and surroundings. <i>--Carey Green</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The New Ontario Naturalized Garden</h2><p><p>Who decides which plants are weeds?

For the doctor, its the beginning of a journey into a world of fear, deception, and murder. Because somehow, Blues extraordinary inner life is linked to Cals reality. And in the mystery of the teenagers mind lies the key to a more terrible mystery: Marie Bradleys hidden past.</p><p>A wife who's too good to be true usually isn't, and the clich� holds true in Andrew Klavan's engrossing little thriller. Psychiatrist Cal Bradley is married to Marie, a devout, adoring, sensuous helpmate, and he's happier than he ever thought he'd be. In fact, he's surprisingly content to ignore the signs that something in her past is still troubling her deeply, until he sees his wife in the arms of a stranger. Then young Peter Blue, accused of battering his girlfriend and setting a church on fire, comes under Cal's care. When Peter discloses his relationship with the stranger Cal saw in the woods with his wife, Marie's past suddenly explodes into the present, threatening to turn Cal's world upside down. There's not a lot of subtlety here. The conclusion is practically handed to the reader on the first page, with its heavy foreshadowing. But the novel works anyway because of Klavan's deft characterization of Peter, a complex, spiritual adolescent who forces Cal to confront his own conscience and his conflict between love and duty. <i>--Jane Adams</i>"Andrew Klavan may be one of the beat authors of psychological suspense writing today." <i>The Rocky Mountain News</i><br><br>"A tour de force...

Bruce Allison celebrates Wisconsin's most significant, unusual, and historic trees. More than one hundred tales introduce us to trees across the state, some remarkable for their size or age, others for their intriguing histories. From magnificent elms to beloved pines to Frank Lloyd Wright's oaks, these trees are woven into our history, contributing to our sense of place. They are anchors for time-honored customs, manifestations of our ideals, and reminders of our lives' most significant events.</p><p>For this updated edition, Allison revisits the trees' histories and tells us which of these unique landmarks are still standing. He sets forth an environmental message as well, reminding us to recognize our connectedness to trees and to manage our tree resources wisely. As early Wisconsin conservationist Increase Lapham said, "Tree histories increase our love of home and improve our hearts. They deserve to be told and remembered."</p></p><p><p><b>R. Bruce Allison</b> has been a professional arborist in Madison, Wisconsin, since 1974. He has earned degrees from Brown University and from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

After reading Allison's book I predict many more odes to Wisconsin trees. Not only a history of Wisconsin's famous trees, Allison's book is also a wonderful travel guide highlighting special trees and special places in every corner of the state. This book was written for all of us who have ever appreciated the beauty, shade and memories that trees provide." (<b>Shelley Ryan, Master Gardener and host of Wisconsin Public Television's The Wisconsin Gardener)</b>&nbsp;"What a marvelous gift Bruce Allison gives us in <i>Every Root an Anchor</i>. His storytelling approach entertains even as he is educating. He reminds us that trees represent more than just the flow of history. Trees also become characters in the lives of people. We interact with them just as we do with human characters, be it a hanging tree, a treaty-signing tree, or my own Big Maple. Included here is a legend of the Black Hawk Tree. An icon of my childhood, it stood in the middle of a street in Prairie du Chien, auto traffic threading past on either side. Did Black Hawk really hide in the tree? That is less important than the fact that the story told is the sad ending of a dying people. Allison knows that trees can speak, and he translates for them and helps them tell their stories." (<b>Ben Logan, author of <i>The Land Remembers</i></b>)&nbsp;"<i>Every Root an Anchor </i>is a book rich in history. It exposes the long history of humans interacting with nature. A sense of history should be the most precious gift of science and art. A single tree, if read closely, can become the biography of a family, an area, or a generation of people. For all of its simplicity, a tree can reveal a fundamental message, a world of nuance and significance. Aldo Leopold expressed his feeling and understanding in planting a tree: 'Acts of creation are ordinarily reserved for gods and poets, but humbler folk may circumvent this restriction if they know how. To plant a pine, for example, one need be neither god nor poet; one need only own a shovel. By virtue of this curious loophole in the rules, any clodhopper may say: Let there be a tree &#x2014; and there will be one.'"

That the Great Basin has inspired such a complex variety of responses is partly due to its enigmatic vastness and isolation, partly to the remarkable range of peoples who have found themselves in the region. Using not only the materials of traditional geography but folklore, anthropology, Native American and Euro-American religion, contemporary politics, and New Age philosophies, Francaviglia has produced a timely investigation of the role of human conceptions of place in that space we call the Great Basin.</p><p>Richard V. Francaviglia is professor of history and geography at the University of Texas at Arlington and serves as director for the Center for Greater Southwestern Studies and the History of Cartography.The Great Basin encompasses the vast deserts and mountains of Utah and Nevada and a complex overlay of faiths. Historical geographer Francaviglia has been traversing and contemplating this austere, mysterious, and majestic land for four decades and creates a palimpsest similar to George Johnson's portrait of New Mexico, <i>Fire in the Mind</i> (1995), as he illuminates the interplay between landscape and the imagination. Fluently scientific yet open to other modes of perception, he parses the region's natural history in connection with Native American spirituality, Mormon beliefs and culture, and the apocalyptic presence of nuclear weapons, which dramatize as nothing ever has before the cosmic dance between creation and destruction. Plainspoken yet eloquent, Francaviglia is at once awed by, for example, the startling phenomenon known as dust devils, conversant in their physical dynamics, attuned to their mystical aspects, and intrigued by the implications of their name, which is part of the desert's remarkably religious lexicon. An exceptionally illuminating travelogue, Francaviglia's many-faceted inquiry reveals the genius loci of a unique and powerful place. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He is now an author specialising in information books for children. He lives in Cheshire with his wife, a book designer, and their two children.Grade 4-6-At first glance, these profusely illustrated books appear to be a lighthearted approach to some grim chapters in the history of the world. Chapter titles are often blithe and the cartoon art depicts the gory and abominable treatment of one group of people by another. But closer examination of the texts and pictures reveals informative books, packed full of the facts students often seek. The first title describes the life of a woman from the Black Sea area who is kidnapped and taken to serve as a slave in ancient Greece. The treatment of the slaves by the aristocracy is depicted along with descriptions of everyday life. Gladiator highlights the superiority of the Roman army, which returned its prisoners to Rome where they were trained to be arena fighters. Rules of battle and types of gladiators are described. Mention is also made of the simulated sea battles that took place in the flooded arenas and of staged wild-animal hunts. Mummy covers the process of embalming and mummification along with the symbolic features of an Egyptian burial. Discoveries of tombs and modern beliefs about mummies are also included. While these books cover material included in other titles, their approach to history will be extremely popular with students who relish a bit of blood and guts along with their historical facts.<br><i>Elizabeth Stumpf, Clearfield Middle School, PA </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Family Treasures Cookbook Vol II</h2><p>288 pages with health section</p><p></p><h2>The University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary, Fourth Edition: Spanish-English, English-Spanish</h2><p>A concise dictionary of words and phrases for today&#39;s usage.

Surprisingly, though, herein lays the biggest opportunity for improving growth and profitability in a world in which consumers are tapped out and competition is coming from the devastating combination of low-wage countries with high skills.<br>&nbsp;<br>For more than a decade, following his landmark <i>Reengineering the Corporation, </i>Michael Hammer did "deep dives" into the processes of companies in every imaginable business--from oil refineries to software developers, factories, retailers, and hospitals--to understand the nuts and bolts of <i>how</i> they do their work, and then to advise them how to do it differently to become faster, cheaper, better. The results were the right product, at the right time, with the right price and quality--businesses that not only ate the competitions' lunch but their breakfast and dinner, too. <br>&nbsp;<br>The research and passion Dr. Hammer brought to this book have been ably carried on, following his tragic and unexpected death in 2008, by his colleague, Lisa Hershman, now the CEO of Hammer and Company.

HERSHMAN is the CEO of the DeNovo Group.When Hammer (coauthor of Reengineering the Corporation) died in 2008, he had nearly completed a first draft of a new treatise on business transformation. Finished by Hershman, CEO of Hammer and Company, this timely book focuses on the revolutionary potential of process improvement in an era of increasingly intense competition. Hershman presents seven essential principles (identifying and fine-tuning such factors as "who does the work," "where the work is done," etc.) and a tool kit of nine "levers," or changes, for how actual work streams can be organized and executed more effectively in companies across industries and across the globe. Case studies in the final section show how these end-to-end process re-engineerings have been applied in real enterprises, including Tetrapak, a packaging equipment company; Gamesa, a Mexico-based leader in cookie production; and Hattaway, a specialty metals-forming business. Easy to read, down-to-earth, and filled with nuggets of practical business wisdom, this eye-opening work is imminently applicable for business owners, leaders, and managers at all levels. (Dec.)

From her guest appearance as a pawn in a chess match to her meeting with Humpty Dumpty, Through the Looking Glass follows Alice on her curious adventure and shows Carroll's great skill at creating an imaginary world full of the fantastical and extraordinary.</p></p><p><p>This 1872 sequel to Lewis Carroll's beloved <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> finds the inquisitive heroine in a fantastic land where everything is reversed. Looking-glass land, a topsy-turvy world lurking just behind the mirror over Alice's mantel, is a fantastic realm of live chessmen, madcap kings and queens, strange mythological creatures, talking flowers and puddings, and rude insects.<br>Brooks and hedges divide the lush greenery of looking-glass land into a chessboard, where Alice becomes a pawn in a bizarre game of chess involving Humpty Dumpty, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Lion and the Unicorn, the White Knight, and other nursery-rhyme figures. Promised a crown when she reaches the eighth square, Alice perseveres through a surreal landscape of amusing characters that pelt her with riddles and humorous semantic quibbles and regale her with memorable poetry, including the oft-quoted "Jabberwocky."</p><p></p><p>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll (1832&#x2013;1898), was an English writer, mathematician, logician, deacon and photographer. He is most famous for his timeless classics, Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.

Actually he goes as far as claiming that reading is a biological necessity in the same way as eating is. Reading is thinking, imagining, understanding, feeling and healing. It is an activity that is far from an escape or an avoidance of reality because it provides the reader the necessary relief from the ad hoc reacting and chaos of socialising by taking care of us, leading us and letting us imagine alternative lives through the complex paths of experience and language. </p><p> In this sense reading truly is a therapeutic experience and Mr Gold gives numerous examples of patients he managed to cure by giving them novels to read because they are an experiential tool for re-seeing and reordering the reader's own confusing experience. Novels take on our confusion, they bear our burdens and leave us to see the larger picture we cannot see because they offer another perspective. </p><p> Reading being the most powerful and plentiful source of information, it isn't surprising that a vital element for the survival of any totalitarian regime is to take control of what people read because language is power. Authors like Aldus Huxley, George Orwell and above all Ray Bradbury have masterfully illustrated this point in their novels, the latter showing what happens to a civilisation in which television replaces literacy. People may still be able to read but they are what we may call "literary illiterates". </p><p> No doubt Mr Gold's message is clear: we have to read for the salvation of our spirit. </p></p><p><p> Joseph Gold is a Fitzhenry and Whiteside author. </p>"...a highly practical guide on the uses of literature in coping." -- <i>The Toronto Star</i><br><br>"...welcomes all who can read to get in touch with our inner lives and restore ourselves through reading." -- <i>The Globe and Mail</i></p><h2>Fighter Escort (Tales of the RAF)</h2><p>These are the stories of young Harry Winslow and his friendships with the pilots of the Royal Air Force in World War II England.

Although there are 6 volumes in a set, only those pertaining to the latitudes anticipated need to be obtained. Their tabular data, being purely mathematical results, never go out of date. The latitudes listed for the Volumes work for either northern or southern hemisphere. This six-volume series of Sight Reduction Tables for Marine Navigation is designed to facilitate the practice of celestial navigation at sea by the Marcq Saint Hilaire or intercept method. The tabular data are the solutions of the navigational triangle of which two sides and the included angle are known and it is necessary to find the values of the third side and adjacent angle. The tables, intended for use with The Nautical Almanac, are designed for precise interpolation of altitude for declination by means of interpolation tables which facilitate linear interpolation and provide additionally for the effect of second differences when required.</p><p></p><h2>All the Plants of the Bible : Text and Illustrations</h2><p>A new, large-format edition of the popular classic presents fascinating facts and lore about every flower, fruit, tree, shrub, and herb mentioned in the Bible, with scripture references and full-color illustrations</p><p></p><h2>Do Not Disturb: The Mysteries of Animal Hibernation and Sleep</h2><p>Looks at how animals prepare for long and short dormant periods and discusses the behavior of bears, woodchucks, squirrels, snakes, and hummingbirds</p><p><p>Gr 3-6-- An easily read, thorough, and up-to-date exploration of hibernation; estivation (summertime hibernation); and sleep in mammals, birds, and fish.

She was nervous when she went to her first class: "I couldn't shake from my mind the pictures I'd seen in yoga books of gaunt, solemn men, wearing what looked like giant diapers, with one leg wrapped around their necks, and cold, expressionless women in Jack LaLanne-style polyester unitards nonchalantly twisting, bending, and lifting themselves into torturous positions." Dillman successfully dispels myths like these, explaining how she slowly learned that yoga can be an uplifting, individual pursuit, and one that reduced her fatigue, boosted her flexibility, and may very well have saved her sanity. Her awe and respect for the art of yoga is palpable, making <i>The Little Yoga Book</i> a big pleasure to read.</p></p><h2>Rock and Gem A definitive guide to rocks, minerals, gems and fossils</h2><p>A remarkable study of the Earth&#39;s rocks, minerals, gems, and fossils, this stunning volume reveals the beauty and wonder of these outstanding natural phenomena and the fascinating ways they have been prized and used.

An only child raised in a Catholic middle-class family in suburban Maryland, Duffy sees the 1962 death of his mother&#x2014;essentially by medical malpractice&#x2014; as what pushed him to be a writer. Duffy graduated from the University of Maryland in 1973, and has hitchhiked twice across the United States, worked construction, washed dishes, hopped freight trains with hoboes, and reported stories that have taken him to Haiti, Bosnia, and Taliban Afghanistan. Today he lives just outside Washington, D.C., works as a speechwriter, is married to a psychotherapist, and has two grown daughters and a stepson.

He lives in Maryland.<br><br></p>Improbable as it may seem, this long, sometimes complex first novel featuring the influential Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and his colleagues/friends/rivals, Cambridge philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, is abundant with life and almost unflaggingly interesting. Deviating only when it must from the record, the lightly fictionalized work progresses chronologically through the convolutions of Wittgenstein's career: his early life in Austria; his arrival in Cambridge; his experiences in the first World War; his unhappy memories of his brilliantly gifted older brothers, both homosexual, both suicides; his relations with a rich, powerful, autocratic father; and his succession of young male friends. All the while Russell is reeling from Lady Ottoline Morrell (of Bloomsbury fame) to a series of wives and other wandering women and the good Moore, already far from young, is marrying happily. The enigmatic Wittgenstein could imagine the unimaginable, but never would he have imagined it possible that he would one day appear as the protagonist of a noveland a delightful one, at that. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All Change (Cazalet Chronicles- 5)</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Taijiquan: The Art Of Nurturing, The Science Of Power</h2><p>Taijiquan: The Art Of Nurturing, The Science Of Power [Hardcover] Yang Yang (Author) Scott A.

Wylie invented the intellectual framework and terminology with which to understand strategy as a means of control. He synthesized the four existing specific theories of strategy into one general theory that is as valid today as when it was first created. Wylie has written a penetrating new postscript especially for this "Classics of Sea Power" edition that takes an up-to-the-minute look at such topics as terrorism, Nicaraguan politics, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. To supplement the text, John Hattendorg's introduction presents a detailed intellectual biography of Wylie. In addition, several of Wylie's most significant shorter writings are included as appendixes. J.C. Wylie retired from the U.S. Navy as a rear admiral in 1972, after a forty-four-year naval career that included service as chief of staff as the Naval War College. John B. Hattendorf is Ernest J.

He contends that it is through music that the powerful myth of Russia's "national character" can best be understood. Russian art music, like Russia itself, Taruskin writes, has "always [been] tinged or tainted ... with an air of alterity--sensed, exploited, bemoaned, reveled in, traded on, and defended against both from within and from without." The author's goal is to explore this assumption of otherness in an all-encompassing work that re-creates the cultural contexts of the folksong anthologies of the 1700s, the operas, symphonies, and ballets of the 1800s, the modernist masterpieces of the 1900s, and the hugely fraught but ambiguous products of the Soviet period.</p><br><p> Taruskin begins by showing how enlightened aristocrats, reactionary romantics, and the theorists and victims of totalitarianism have variously fashioned their vision of Russian society in musical terms. He then examines how Russia as a whole shaped its identity in contrast to an "East" during the age of its imperialist expansion, and in contrast to two different musical "Wests," Germany and Italy, during the formative years of its national consciousness. The final section, expanded from a series of Christian Gauss seminars presented at Princeton in 1993, focuses on four individual composers, each characterized both as a self-consciously Russian creator and as a European, and each placed in perspective within a revealing hermeneutic scheme. In the culminating chapters--Chaikovsky and the Human, Scriabin and the Superhuman, Stravinsky and the Subhuman, and Shostakovich and the Inhuman--Taruskin offers especially thought-provoking insights, for example, on Chaikovsky's status as the "last great eighteenth-century composer" and on Stravinsky's espousal of formalism as a reactionary, literally counterrevolutionary move.</p></p><p><p>"Richard Taruskin has again demonstrated that anything he writes leads to serious thinking and reevaluation of hitherto held views. His erudition and mastery of the field as well as his ability to see beyond the surface the implications not easily grasped by a non-Russian make this work required reading for anyone seeking a full understanding of music in Russia."--<b>Milo&#x161; Velimirovi?, <i>Professor Emeritus, University of Virginia</i></b></p><p>"It is most unusual for a top-ranking scholar to write both broad and deep, for the general public and for a specialized circle, in a field as technically demanding as music. In this new book, Taruskin continues to remake the map of Russian music by focusing on the Russians' experience with 'outsideness.' On the border between East and West, Russian culture has always been better at absorption and transformation than at isolation and exclusion. With its implicit hope that Westerners might become responsible, informed 'others' to the Russian tradition, Taruskin's study covers several centuries of this generous eclecticism so that it reads like a Russian novel. It is a spectacular and timely project."--<b>Caryl Emerson, Princeton University</b></p><b>Richard Taruskin</b>, Professor of Music at the University of California, Berkeley, is a regular contributor to <i>New Republic</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Opera News</i>, and many scholarly publications.

Madrid grew up in a family that was doubly removed from the community: as Hispanic Protestants, they were a minority among the region's politically dominant Anglo Protestants and a minority within the overwhelmingly Catholic Hispanic populace.<br><br>Madrid writes affectingly of the tensions, rifts, and disputes that punctuated the lives of his family as they negotiated prejudice and racism, casual and institutional, to advance and even thrive as farmers, ranchers, and teachers. His story is affectionate as well, embracing generations of ancestors who found their querencias their beloved home places in that beautiful if sometimes unforgiving landscape. The result is an account of New Mexico unlike any other, one in which humor and heartache comfortably coexist. Complemented by stunning images by acclaimed photographer Miguel Gandert -- ranging from intimate pictures of unkempt rural cemeteries to New Mexico's small villages and stunning vistas -- In the Country of Empty Crosses is a memoir of loss and survival, of hope and redemption, and a lyrical celebration of an often misunderstood native land and its people.</p><p>Arturo Madrid is the Murchison Distinguished Professor of Humanities at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.

In the midst of feasting, the women starve, dragging their emaciated bodies to serve their masters and afterwards licking up the half-chewed bits of skin and gristle, the spewed-out bones. Yet in the Angels' Kitchen the copper gleams, the fruits glisten, cauldrons bubble, and the women chorus, "Soup, beautiful soup."

It has uplifted lives in every civilization and every era, from dirt playgrounds to marble palaces. It has survived catastrophic acts of inhumanity, ignorance, and apathy, to bloom in the darkest days as well as the brightest hours of human existence. It has illuminated our lives with flashes of singular brilliance in advances in human understanding and in the softer, warmer light of words or deeds that daily enrich the human experience.</p><p>Each one of us is endowed with the spirit of creativity, whether we recognize it or not. We see it easily in the young child who turns a bed into a sailing ship and pillows into fortresses. We readily admire it in the brilliant pianist or determined inventor. We celebrate it in the ingenious efforts of survival by those caught in the path of nature's fury or the storms of war and other human cruelty. But we tend to overlook the same creative energy when, transformed by age and experience, it leads a retired chemist to become an education activist, or prompts a once travel-shy homemaker to take her first vacation abroad. Creative potential is there in all of us, an inner resource, renewable and vibrant, no matter how much or how little it is used. This creative spirit has the power to change our lives at every age, and to do so in quite different ways as we get older.</p><p>Playwright George Bernard Shaw believed in lifelong creativity. He espoused this belief in his writing, reflected in the chapter's opening quote, and he practiced it throughout his lifetime. Despite adversity in the earlier days of his writing career, Shaw persevered. He wrote <i>Back to Methuselah</i> when he was sixty-six, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925, at the age of sixty-nine. He continued to write for more than two decades and was at work on a comedy when he died at age ninety-four.</p><p>Shaw's contribution to literature is of historic measure, and not only for the pleasure of scholars. Like so many products of the creative spirit, his ideas found new expression in the lives of others. Years after the playwright died, when Sen. Robert Kennedy repeated Shaw's urging to "dream things that never were: and say, 'Why not?' " it was to inspire a new generation of creative social and political action that would, itself, earn a prominent place in history.</p><p>As we explore the powerful potential that creativity brings to us as we age, we can begin by posing Shaw's question anew. Each of us, in our own life, needs to dream things that have not happened for us and ask: "Why not?" After all, modern science and medicine have strengthened the foundations of life as we age. Preliminary research and evidence from life around us makes clear that creativity is a catalyst for change of the best kind, with benefits that are immediate, long-lasting, and within the reach of every person. Even more interesting is that as we age, some key ingredients for creativity--life experience and the long view-are only enhanced. In studies of aging people and in my work with them, four aspects of creativity stand out:</p><p>1. <i>Creativity strengthens our morale in later life.</i> Creativity allows us to alter our experience of problems, and sometimes to transcend them, in later life. Part of the nature of creativity is its engaging and sustaining quality--no matter what our actual physical condition, we feel better when we are able to view our circumstances with fresh perspective and express ourselves with some creativity. Creativity makes us more emotionally resilient and better able to cope with life's adversity and losses. Just as exercise improves our muscle tone, when we are creatively engaged, our emotional tone is elevated.</p><p>2. <i>Creativity contributes to physical health as we age.</i> Increasing numbers of preliminary findings from psychoneuroimmunological studies--research that examines the interaction of our emotions, our brain function, and our immune system--suggest that a positive outlook and a sense of well-being have a beneficial effect on the functioning of our immune system and our overall health. These findings are particularly strong among older persons.</p><p> Creative expression typically fosters feelings that can improve outlook and a sense of well-being. Just as chronic unrelieved stress has a detrimental effect on the immune system, continuing creativity, by promoting the expression of emotions, promotes an immune function boost.</p><p>3. <i>Creativity enriches relationships. </i>For young or middle-aged adults, knowing there is a potential for creativity in later life will improve their outlook and expectations of those years. Adult children with optimistic expectations of aging typically are more comfortable discussing issues of aging and other life passages with their parents. The effect is a boon for both generations: the younger adult learns first hand about achieving a more satisfying aging experience, and the older adult remains engaged in the circle of relationship and emotional intimacy that strengthens connections to others and richness of life.</p><p>4. <i>Creativity is our greatest legacy.</i> To be creative in later life provides an invaluable model of what is possible as we age, for our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and society. As a role model in your family or in the lives of others, you can shape individual thinking and societal policies about aging. Historically, creativity has distinguished elders as "keepers" of the culture, those who pass the history and values of family and community on to the next generation.</p><p>Most of us will never win the Nobel Peace Prize or a Presidential election, but we can use creativity to shape our lives and, especially as we age, to unleash new potential for personal growth and self-expression. Before we can fully access our creative potential in aging, we need to clear away the internal and external obstacles to understanding...</p></p><h2>The Big Box</h2><p>In her first illustrated book for children, the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author Toni Morrison introduces three feisty children who show grown-ups what it really means to be a kid.</p><p>If Pulitzer Prize-winning Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and her son Slade hope to reach children with their rhyming message of personal freedom and individuality, they may have missed the mark. But if even a few excessively controlling grownups learn to "let children be children," this big, colorful picture book might serve its purpose after all. Patty, Mickey, and Liza Sue live in a big brown box (locked from the inside) with all the amenities a modern child dreams of: TV, Barbie, pizza, Spice Girls T-shirts, beanbag chairs, and Pepsi. All this, but no liberty. They've been placed in this box because the adults in their lives believe "those kids can't handle their freedom." They have too much fun in school, sing when they should be studying, feed honey to the bees, and play handball where they shouldn't. Parents, neighbors, and teachers are uncomfortable with these irrepressible children, and hope to control them with strict boundaries. Meanwhile, the younger-yet-wiser children just want the freedom to become themselves: "Even sparrows scream/ And rabbits hop/ And beavers chew trees when they need 'em./ I don't mean to be rude: I want to be nice,/ But I'd like to hang on to my freedom."<p> Giselle Potter's lovely, childlike paintings create an atmosphere of na�ve bewilderment, as the plaintive children wail, over and over, "If freedom is handled just <i>your</i> way/ Then it's not my freedom or free." Morrison's first foray into children's literature is a puzzling, thickly ironic book that asks more questions than it answers. Even as a celebration of the unfettered exuberance of children in the face of societal oppression, a lighter touch would have done wonders. (Click to see a sample spread. Text copyright 1999 by Toni Morrison. Illustrations copyright 1999 by Giselle Potter. With permission of Jump at the Sun, Hyperion Books for Children.) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>"Shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy." Wordsworth's famous line could be the theme of Morrison's first picture book, coauthored by her son, who "devised" the story when he was nine. It's about three contemporary kids imprisoned because their imagination and spontaneity threaten the conformist adult world. Patty's a rebel in the classroom; she makes the heavy-browed, therapeutic grown-ups nervous. Mickey upsets his city neighborhood. Liza frees the animals on the farm. So, for their own good, the three children must be locked away in a big, brown box. The box is comfortable, even pretty, filled with cool consumer stuff, but there are three locks on the door, which opens only one way. Allthough the sing-song, rhyming narrative suffers from a didactic refrain about the joyful natural world outside, where animals scream, rabbits hop, and "beavers chew trees when they need 'em," Potter's large-size double-spread illustrations in naive style effectively contrast the stiff, luxurious details of the human prison with the openness and color of the primitive wilderness to which the triumphant rebellious trio escape and run with the animals in the light. Disobedience, nonconformity, and imaginative play are at the heart of many great children's books, from Maurice Sendak's 1963 classic, <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, to Rosemary Wells' subversive <i>Timothy Goes to School</i> (1981); in contrast, Morrison's story is simplistic and sentimental. Older kids may want to talk about the sinister prison images of dystopia, but the message about individual freedom is too heavily spelled out, three times in fact. The story will appeal most to adults who cherish images of childhood innocence in a fallen world. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Skeleton Crew</h2><p>Mystery and horror.</p><p>In the introduction to <i>Skeleton Crew</i> (1985), his second collection of stories, King pokes fun at his penchant for "literary elephantiasis," makes scatological jokes about his muse, confesses how much money he makes (gross and net), and tells a story about getting arrested one time when he was "suffused with the sort of towering, righteous rage that only drunk undergraduates can feel." He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: "Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way."<p> And he sure does. <i>Skeleton Crew</i> contains a superb short novel ("The Mist") that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. </p><p> In addition to "The Mist," the real standout is "The Reach," a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across "the Reach," the body of water between island and mainland. This is the story that King fans give to their friends who don't read horror in order to show them how literate, how charming a storyteller he can be.

BOMC Main.</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.It's Corduroy's big day, and although he is pushing 30, he doesn't look a day over 5; in the years since his first appearance he has learned how to keep both straps of his overalls buttoned. He's invited over to Checkboard Bunny's home (for what will be a surprise party) but finds time before the party to ``recycle his newspapers and donate clothes that no longer fit him to the children's shelter.'' He also ``chooses some cans of food for the food bank.'' These are worthy activities, but entirely out of step with lighthearted action in the rest of the book, as Corduroy goes off to the party for a good time. The book brims with lift-up flaps, allowing children to get right in on the action: locating the hiding places of the guests, opening gifts, watching the birthday candles go from fire to smoke when the bear blows them out. Corduroy remains a winsome fellow, but those familiar with the older books (and who have not been eased into this series of knock-offs illustrated by McCue) will find no hint of the bear's urban roots (he lives in suburbia now), nor of the little girl who brought him home from the department store. Call it a lift- the-flap, call it a birthday book, but don't call it Don Freeman's Corduroy (1968). (Picture book. 2-6) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The &#x201c;change&#x201d; is not simply a collection of physical symptoms to be &#x201c;fixed,&#x201d; Dr. Northrup claims, but a mind/body revolution that brings the greatest opportunity for growth since adolescence. The choices a woman makes now&#x2013;from the quality of her relationships to the quality of her diet&#x2013;have the power to secure her health and well-being for the rest of her life. Through her personal story and many fascinating case histories, Dr. Northrup shows:<br><br>� How menopause jump-starts changes in the brain, issuing a dramatic wake-up call to body, mind, and emotions<br>� How to ensure the long-term health of breasts, bones, and heart<br>� How the body adjusts naturally to changing hormones<br>� Why bestselling drugs like Premarin may not be the best choice<br>� How to deal with metabolism shifts, weight gain, sexual problems, and appearance issues<br>� How to negotiate the challenges of &#x201c;the empty nest&#x201d; and midlife marriage<br><br>And much more. <br><br>In a book destined to be a classic, Dr. Northrup shows women how they can make menopause a time of personal empowerment and positive energy&#x2013;emerging wiser, healthier, and stronger in both mind and body than ever before.</p><p>Menopause doesn't have to be a dreaded curse of aging during which we can look forward only to hot flashes and whacked-out hormonal mood swings. According to Christiane Northrup, M.D. (<i>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</i>), menopause often marks the beginning of a woman's most sexually passionate, creatively inspired, and professionally productive phase of life.<p> While this may sound like wishful thinking, Northrup backs up her good news with solid medical expertise. As an obstetrician and gynecologist, Northrup has specialized in using a mind-body approach to women's health for decades, which means she doesn't just write about hormones, but also examines how a woman's lifestyle, emotions, and beliefs are affected by menopause. With the right diet, attitude, and perhaps some supplements along the way, women can actually look forward to a resurgence of energy and a revolutionary opportunity for personal growth--one that rivals the hormonally driven period of adolescence in its scope and urgency, she claims. And yes, at just under 500 pages, <i>The Wisdom of Menopause</i> does explain how to have a positive and healthy menopause in concise detail. Northrup has indeed "written the book" on menopause.</p><p> It helps that Northrup has been through menopause herself (she vowed she wouldn't write a book on it until she was on the other side). Readers have the sense that they are gleaning advice from a knowledgeable holistic doctor as well as a sage aunt whose life was radically altered by the "change of life" (Northrup divorced at the onset of menopause). After she shares her personal story of "the change," Northrup delves into a significant discussion on how self-sacrifice catches up with women in midlife. Suddenly, hormones are directing women out of the caregiver role and into an inwardly focused assessment of life and its meaning, she explains. Resentments (not hormones) are what spur the notorious surges of anger, as women reexamine the agreements surrounding their relationships with colleagues, friends, and family members.</p><p> From here, Northrup guides readers into a thorough section on menopausal hormone changes--a discussion that is scientifically informative, yet entirely accessible. While acknowledging the need for hormone-replacement therapy and the tremendous relief it can provide (helping to alleviate insomnia, hot flashes, and depression), Northrup encourages women to avoid synthetic hormones and instead consider "bioidentical" hormones (such as estradiol, estrone, and estriol). She also devotes an entire chapter to foods and supplements that support hormonal balance. By the way, she says to skip the wild Mexican yam creams: "they certainly don't provide the documented benefits of progesterone." Be warned: some readers may find the advice in <i>Wisdom of Menopause</i> too alternative for their liking. For example, in her discussion on insomnia, one of Northrup's recommendations is to cover the mirror at night, following the ancient Asian design principles of feng shui. (Skeptics will find Northrup's medical assertions carefully cited and footnoted in the rear of her book.)</p><p> Northrup gives a solid and practical diet plan that supports hormonal balance while countering the weight gain that so frequently plagues menopausal women ("focus on portion size, not calories," "eat protein at every meal," and cut down on refined and high-carbohydrate foods). Readers can also expect a thorough mind-body discussion in subsequent chapters that cover breast health, bone loss, and cultivating midlife beauty, along with chapters titled "Sex and Menopause: Myths and Reality" and "Creating Pelvic Health and Power."</p><p> She concludes with a list of mail-order and online resources, such as retailers for bioidentical hormones, progesterone cream, Chinese herbs, soy products, weight-loss audiocassettes, lubricants, and Kegel weights. Northrup takes a truly comprehensive approach to all the effective treatments of menopausal symptoms so that women can make their own highly informed and wise choices. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>"Northrup writes from experience and, more important, from her professional expertise as a physician who has treated many women and researched menopause. The specific medical advice on sleep, diet, breast health and the empowerment motif will bring insight, comfort and confidence to women embarked on 'the change.'"<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>Praise for <b>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</b>:<br><br>"Feminine wisdom is the intelligence at the heart of creation.

Cherlin&#x2019;s three decades of study and analysis of family life, he came to see that marriage in the United States was different than in other Western countries&#x2014;Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand&#x2014;in a way that no one was writing about. He realized that marriage in America, unlike in other countries in the world, was seen as a cultural idael, and the U.S. government was spending money to promote its continuation. The institution of marriage had become a social and political battlefield.<br><br>Cherlin writes that Americans marry more repeatedly and have more live-in partners; that marriage and remarriage, frequent divorce, and short-term cohabiting relationships have resulted in a core upheaval in American family life; and that American children have been left to cope with the frequent and disruptive comings and goings of parents.<br><br>He writes that Americans have come to embrace two contradictory models of personal and family life: marriage, a formal commitment to share one&#x2019;s life with another; and individualism, which emphasizes personal growth and development. The former promotes a lasting relationship; the latter encourages one to move on. Each model is culturally reinforced by two basic, powerful institutions: religion and law.<br><br>Cherlin writes about the inconsistency of American religion and law with regard to family life. He argues that contemporary religion, although supportive of marriage, embraces the quest for self-development. And he makes clear that family law, which used to be centered on marriage, is today focused on the individual and his or her obligations to children.<br><br>He discusses the movement and civil struggle for same-sex marriage in America as opposed to in many European countries, where marriage is seen by gay couples as an oppressive heterosexual institution.<br><br>A fascinating book that illuminates the shifting nature of America&#x2019;s oldest and most cherished social institution, the subject of intense and ever-increasing national debate.</p><p>Andrew J.

He lives in Baltimore.chapter 1<br><br>65<br><br>How American Family Life Is Different<br><br>On Valentine&#x2019;s Day in 2005, Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who would gain recognition in 2008 as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and his wife, Janet, converted their marriage to a covenant marriage in front of a crowd of 6,400 at an arena in North Little Rock. The governor was aware that few Arkansas couples were choosing the covenant option&#x2014;of the first hundred thousand or so marriages that had begun since it was introduced in 2001, about six hundred couples had chosen it. In Louisiana and Arizona, the other states that offered covenant marriages, the take- up rate wasn&#x2019;t much better. Advocates for covenant marriage claimed that many couples were unaware of it and that the laws had been poorly implemented. Even so, the numbers were far smaller than anyone expected. Those who chose Arkansas&#x2019;s option agreed to undergo premarital counseling. They also agreed that if either spouse ever requested a divorce, they would attend marital counseling before splitting up. And they agreed that neither spouse could obtain a quick divorce based on &#x201c;no-fault&#x201d; grounds such as incompatibility. Only if the other spouse had committed a serious transgression such as adultery or physical or sexual abuse could a covenant-married person ask for an immediate divorce. Otherwise, the person who wanted out had to wait at least two years for a divorce.<br><br>In order to breathe life into this moribund option, the governor had announced his intention to enter into a covenant marriage and invited others to join him. &#x201c;This law allows couples to choose to be held to a higher level of marital commitment,&#x201d; he said in a radio address promoting his rally. At the event, thousands of married couples, many bused by their churches, filed into the arena as love songs played on the public address system. After the governor and his wife exchanged vows, they asked the couples in the audience to stand and face each other, and they led a mass recitation of vows. Only the Huckabees&#x2019; ceremony legally counted as a covenant marriage, however, because couples who are already married must submit an affidavit to the county clerk in order to convert their marriages, and according to news reports the logistics had proven too complicated for the churches that were supporting the rally. Nevertheless, the governor, a former Baptist pastor, had made his point: there was too much divorce in Arkansas and people&#x2019;s commitment to their marriages needed to be strengthened.<br><br>Governor Huckabee&#x2019;s concern about the divorce rate in Arkansas, which led him to sponsor the Valentine&#x2019;s Day covenant marriage rally, was well-taken. In 2004, for instance, Arkansas had the second-highest number of divorces per person of any state (after Nevada, a divorce destination that does a brisk business with out-of-state visitors). But Governor Huckabee may not have known that Arkansas also had a large number of weddings. In 2004, it had the third-highest per capita rate of marriage (after Nevada and Hawaii, two popular wedding destinations). With much divorce and much marriage, Arkansas exemplifies the American pattern.<br><br>That a state in the Bible Belt&#x2014;Arkansas is well above average in church membership&#x2014;has a high rate of marriage may seem unremarkable; by contrast, its high divorce rate may seem odd. Yet six of the ten states with the highest divorce rates are in the South, and the other four are in the West. George W. Bush carried all ten states in the 2004 presidential election, which suggests that having a socially conservative electorate does not insulate a state from divorce. It is true that people who are religious are less likely to divorce, but religious Americans still have high divorce rates by international standards. Moreover, people in high-divorce states tend to have less education, to marry earlier, and not to be Catholic&#x2014;all of which are risk factors for divorce. That&#x2019;s why Arkansas stands out: it has one of the lowest percentages of high school graduates and of Catholics, and one of the lowest median ages at marriage, of any state.<br><br>Both marriage and divorce contribute to the larger picture of a country in which people partner, unpartner, and repartner faster than do people in any other Western nation. They form cohabiting relationships easily, but they end them after a shorter time than people in other nations. They tend to marry at younger ages. After a divorce, they tend to find a new partner more quickly. In other words, having several partnerships is more common in the United States not just because people exit intimate partnerships faster but also because they enter them faster and after a breakup reenter them faster. We know these facts from the work of demographers using the Fertility and Family Surveys, a remarkable set of surveys conducted between 1989 and 1997 in European countries, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States (as well as from other surveys in Great Britain and Australia, two countries that were not included). In each nation researchers asked a large, random sample of individuals comparable questions about their marriages, divorces, and cohabiting relationships.<br><br>Why, you might ask, did researchers go to the expense and trouble of carrying out these surveys throughout Western Europe and overseas English-speaking countries? The answer is that enormous changes have occurred in family life not only in the United States but also throughout the Western world in the past half century (and in much of the rest of the world, too, for that matter). People everywhere are concerned about the future of the family as they know it. In the Scandinavian countries and in France, cohabitation is even more common than in the United States, and a large proportion of all births occur to cohabiting couples&#x2014;more than half of first births in Sweden. Divorce rates have increased, too, although not to the height seen in the United States. But what drives European concern is not the decline of marriage but rather the decline in births. It&#x2019;s hard for Americans to understand this concern because we don&#x2019;t share it. American women have enough children to maintain the size of our population, even ignoring immigration. In many European countries, in contrast, women are having fewer births. Countries such as France and Germany have long been concerned with keeping their populations up so that they can field armies large enough to defend themselves. More recently, they have been concerned about having enough working-age adults to care for their growing elderly populations.<br><br>In the United States, however, the concern is about marriage, and the Fertility and Family Surveys have much to say about it. To compare, say, current divorce rates across countries, ideally we would interview a sample of people who get married this year in each country, follow them for the next several decades, and see how many become divorced. But no mere mortal has the time to wait that long. Instead, demographers use the &#x201c;life table&#x201d; method, so called because one of its first uses was to estimate how long people would live so that insurance companies could determine how much to charge them for life insurance policies. It can be used to estimate the expected &#x201c;survival&#x201d; time of marriages, cohabiting relationships, or periods of singlehood. Its estimates will be inaccurate if conditions change greatly in the future. Essentially, the life table answers this question: if conditions stay the same as they have been recently, how long would we expect a marriage, a cohabiting relationship, or a spell of being single to last?<br><br>The American Difference<br><br>Here are some comparisons that can be made between women in the United States (the American survey did not include men) and in other Western nations in the mid-1990s, when most of the surveys were conducted:<br><br>� Americans marry and cohabit for the first time sooner than people in most other Western nations. Half of all first marriages occurred by age twenty-five in the United States, compared to age twenty-nine in Italy, thirty in France, thirty-one in Sweden, and thirty-two in the former West Germany. In part, ages of marriage are older in Europe because in some countries more young adults cohabit prior to marrying. Yet even if we consider the age at which half of all first partnerships of either kind (marital or cohabiting) occur, American women were relatively young: age twenty-two, compared to twenty-one in Sweden, age twenty-three in France, twenty-six in West Germany, and twenty-eight in Italy.<br><br>� A higher proportion of Americans marry at some point in their lives than in most other Western nations: 84 percent of American women are predicted to marry by age forty. In contrast, the forecast drops to 70 percent in Sweden and 68 percent in France. (For technical reasons, all of these forecasts are likely to be somewhat lower than the actual percentages who will ever marry.) If we consider both marital and cohabiting relationships, however, over 90 percent of women in nearly all countries will eventually begin an intimate partnership.<br><br>So Americans begin to have partners at a relatively young age, whereas many Europeans wait longer. And Americans turn those partnerships into marriages&#x2014;or marry without living together beforehand&#x2014;much more quickly. In France and the Nordic countries, in contrast, young adults tend to live with partners for several years before marrying, if they marry at all. In some southern European countries, such as Spain and Italy, living together prior to marrying is less common, and many young adults live with their parents well into their twenties before marrying. Other English-speaking countries are more similar to the United States, but people there still marry at somewhat older ages and are less likely to ever marry over their lifetimes.<br><br>� Marriages and cohabiting relationships in the United States are far more fragile than elsewhere.

On the morning of October 1, 1910, the walls of the Los Angeles Times Building buckled as a thunderous detonation sent men, machinery, and mortar rocketing into the night air. When at last the wreckage had been sifted and the hospital triage units consulted, twenty-one people were declared dead and dozens more injured. But as it turned out, this was just a prelude to the devastation that was to come.<br><br>In <i>American Lightning</i>, acclaimed author Howard Blum masterfully evokes the incredible circumstances that led to the original &#x201c;crime of the century&#x201d;&#x2014;and an aftermath more dramatic than even the crime itself. <br><br>With smoke still wafting up from the charred ruins, the city&#x2019;s mayor reacts with undisguised excitement when he learns of the arrival, only that morning, of America&#x2019;s greatest detective, William J. Burns, a former Secret Service man who has been likened to Sherlock Holmes. Surely Burns, already world famous for cracking unsolvable crimes and for his elaborate disguises, can run the perpetrators to ground. <br><br>Through the work of many months, snowbound stakeouts, and brilliant forensic sleuthing, the great investigator finally identifies the men he believes are responsible for so much destruction. Stunningly, Burns accuses the men&#x2014;labor activists with an apparent grudge against the Los Angeles Times&#x2019;s fiercely anti-union owner&#x2014;of not just one heinous deed but of being part of a terror wave involving hundreds of bombings. <br><br>While preparation is laid for America&#x2019;s highest profile trial ever&#x2014;and the forces of labor and capital wage hand-to-hand combat in the streets&#x2014;two other notable figures are swept into the drama: industry-shaping filmmaker D.W. Griffith, who perceives in these events the possibility of great art and who will go on to alchemize his observations into the landmark film The Birth of a Nation; and crusading lawyer Clarence Darrow, committed to lend his eloquence to the defendants, though he will be driven to thoughts of suicide before events have fully played out.<br><br>Simultaneously offering the absorbing reading experience of a can&#x2019;t-put-it-down thriller and the perception-altering resonance of a story whose reverberations continue even today, <i>American Lightning</i> is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction.</p><p>HOWARD BLUM is the author of eight previous books, including the national bestsellers <i>Wanted!, The Gold of Exodus</i>, and <i>Gangland</i>. Currently a contributing editor at <i>Vanity Fair</i>, Blum was also a reporter at the <i>New York Times</i>, where he won numerous journalism awards and was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for his investigative reporting.chapter one<br><br>It was nearly midnight on September 4, 1910, in Peoria, Illinois, when the dark sky above the train yard opened and a pelting rain suddenly poured down. Surprised, the night watchman ran to a boxcar for shelter. That decision saved his life. He was safely inside when the bomb exploded. It was a clock bomb, rather crudely made but fueled by ten gallons of nitroglycerin. It had been placed under a nearby railway car transporting an eighty-ton girder.<br><br>The force of the blast knocked the watchman to the boxcar&#x2019;s wooden floor. Outside the girder shot high into the sky. Shards of metal showered down, spears falling like iron lightning bolts amid the hard, hammering rain.<br><br>Within hours the president of the McClintic-Marshall Iron Works, the company that had fabricated the girder for a bridge being built across the Illinois River, hired the Burns Detective Agency to investigate the blast. A local Burns operative left his bed and hurried to the scene. Under a freight car carrying a second huge girder, he discovered a clock bomb that had failed to explode; the battery had lost its voltage. The clock had also been set for 11 hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds. This would&#x2019;ve allowed sufficient time for any escape. The culprits would be long gone, and, he anticipated, difficult to trace.<br><br>Outside the yard he found an empty nitroglycerin can and a small, neatly piled hill of sawdust. He brought the can and the unexploded bomb to the attention of the Peoria police captain at the scene. The captain glanced at the device, shook his head in a gesture of disgust at the criminals who had planted it, and then walked off to interview the night watchman.<br><br>Later, after the police had left, the Burns man retrieved the can and the bomb. He also gathered up the sawdust particles. He put all the evidence&#x2014;the nitroglycerin can, the unexploded bomb, and the sawdust&#x2014; into a large box and sent it to the agency&#x2019;s headquarters in Chicago.<br><br>For weeks the box sat on a shelf in the evidence room, ignored and unopened. It was only after the events in Los Angeles that Billy Burns began to suspect its significance.<br><br>chapter two<br><br>California, here we come! Over the hills and across the valleys of America, from the icy, windswept prairies and the snowbound farmlands of the Midwest, people flocked to Los Angeles. As the twentieth century began, the city&#x2019;s chamber of commerce spread the word that sunshine would cure any illness, that ripe oranges hung from trees ready for the taking, and that fortunes could be made buying and selling parcels of land. The California Dream captured people&#x2019;s imagination, and day after day Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroad cars filled with newcomers arrived at the Los Angeles station. In just a generation, this pueblo village dozing in the sunshine began to take shape as a city. By 1910 its population approached 900,000, and people were still pouring in. And as the city grew, as its inhabitants prospered, Los Angeles became a battleground.<br><br>It was a battle that was being fought all across America. In western mines, in New England mills, in New York sweatshops, in railroad cars traversing the nation, labor raged against capital. The nation was locked in a class struggle that threatened to erupt into the next civil war.<br><br>At one noncompromising extreme were unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). They urged &#x201c;direct action.&#x201d; Sabotage, violence&#x2014;these were acceptable, even necessary, political weapons. The goal was to place &#x201c;the working class in possession of the economic power, the means of life, in control of the machinery of production and distribution, without regard to capitalist masters.&#x201d; For these radical unionists, &#x201c;there can be no harmony between employer and employee.&#x201d;<br><br>In opposition, capitalists formed militant associations, organizations that were empowered by immense wealth, reinforced by private armies of goons, corrupt police, and hired detectives. They were led by men certain that material success was tangible proof of moral superiority. The associations held that profit must be maximized regardless of the human cost or suffering, and that no union man should be employed.<br><br>The nation was locked in an intense struggle over its future and over the quality of American life and justice. But nowhere in the country did the opposing armies of unions and employers collide with greater frequency than in Los Angeles. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the city had become &#x201c;the bloodiest arena in the Western World for Capital and Labor.&#x201d;<br><br>This long-running confrontation was largely provoked by the sentiments, leadership, and intransigence of one belligerent and self- confident individual&#x2014;Harrison Gray Otis.<br><br>Otis&#x2019;s was, in its meandering, unpredictable way, a typical California success story. He had come to California in 1880, at the age of forty-two, with no more specific ambition than to start over in the bright sunshine. He had been a hero in the Civil War, enlisting in his native Ohio as a Union private, and had risen, after fifteen battles and several wounds, to the rank of captain. But he had had no success in civilian life. His warrior&#x2019;s temperament had difficulty adjusting to the succession of menial jobs that came his way&#x2014;clerk in the Ohio House of Representatives, and then a compositor, later a foreman, in the Government Printing Office. In desperation, he found a position as treasury agent of the Seal Islands in the Bering Sea. With only his wife Eliza for company, he endured a period of detachment and exile. A mountain of a man with a walrus mustache and a wild goatee, bristling with an instinctive aggressiveness, even his speaking voice a thunderous boom, Otis felt caged, his vitality drained, by his life in these bleak, barren islands. He served his three years and then headed to southern California, eager to pursue the vague yet restorative promise in endless blue skies and warm days.<br><br>At first Otis maneuvered to become collector of the Port of San Diego, but when this did not come to fruition, he tried something else. He raised Angora goats. A shepherd&#x2019;s life, however, did not suit the personality of a man who needed a more responsive audience. Once again he soon found himself grasping after something new. As a teenager he had worked in an Ohio printer&#x2019;s shop, and the experience was sufficient qualification to land him the editor&#x2019;s position at the Santa Barbara Press. Santa Barbara was a bucolic coastal village of two thousand, and the weekly published a folksy brand of neighborhood journalism. Otis enjoyed the work, but when Los Angeles&#x2019;s newest paper, the Daily Times, offered him a job writing editorials for a comparatively bountiful fifteen dollars a week, Otis, in his restless way, decided to accept.<br><br>He had not been at the Times very long before it became apparent that the paper was on the verge of bankruptcy. Unless investors could be found, it would cease publication. Otis was forty-four years old, and as he confided to his wife, he had come to the realization that he was running out of chances. Other considerations also had him thinking: His ego had taken to the power and posturing that comes with newspapering; and his instinct alerted him to a day when Los Angeles, although only a drab mud and adobe town of 11,000, would glisten with the shine of opportunity. Otis set out to raise the money needed to keep the Times going. When he succeeded, he was rewarded with a quarter interest in the struggling paper. Four years later, in 1886, he acquired total control. Otis was now sole owner, publisher, and editor in chief. He could run the Times as he saw fit, and unencumbered by either doubts or hesitations, he did. As the city boomed, Otis transformed the Times not only into a commercial success but also into a fiercely conservative, anti-union journal.<br><br>From the start, Otis came out fighting. The Times, like the city&#x2019;s three other dailies, the Herald, the Express, and the Tribune, was a union shop, and in the spring of 1890 he decided to do something about that. Under Otis&#x2019;s leadership, the dailies banded together and announced that they wanted the typographers to accept a 20 percent wage cut. The outraged typographers shot back with their own ultimatum: The owners had twenty-four hours to sign an agreement extending the existing pay scale for another year, or they would go on strike.<br><br>The owners refused to accept the terms&#x2014;at first. After only a day, the Tribune signed. The Express held out for three days. The Herald stood firm for three long and bitter months before it acquiesced. But Otis would not settle. The union men who had walked away from their jobs, he announced, would never return. Their positions would be taken by nonunion workers. Which, after all, had been his objective from the start.<br><br>The Times&#x2019;s pressroom became a combat zone. Union workers fought with &#x201c;scab&#x201d; typographers brought in from Kansas City. Otis, convinced of both the moral and the economic necessity of his position, was relentless. News articles and vituperative editorials in the Times kept up a continuous assault on the printers&#x2019; union and closed-shop unionism.<br><br>The dispute spilled out of the Times Building and spread across the city. Pickets blocked the entrances of stores that advertised in the Times, urging customers not to enter. Merchants who withdrew their advertising were attacked by name in the paper as &#x201c;cowards and cravens.&#x201d; Unions throughout the country announced their support for the printers, and capitalist associations hailed Otis as a hero.<br><br>Within months a pressroom labor dispute had taken on a galvanizing momentum. The city was on edge, bristling with a combative politics. It was as if all of Los Angeles had chosen sides. When Eugene Debs, the Socialist Party leader, announced a national railroad strike, 100,000 Pullman workers around the country walked off their jobs. Los Angeles was immobilized. On June 27, 1894, cargo trains sat abandoned on the tracks. Nothing could come in or go out of the city on rail; and these new frustrations and deprivations ignited the already incendiary mood. Rioting broke out in the streets. The Times Building, a rallying symbol for both labor and capital, became the center of the conflict.<br><br>Blood spilled for an entire week. Union men and sympathizers attacked &#x201c;scabs,&#x201d; ambushed paper carriers, and destroyed press runs before the issues could be distributed. Wielding ax handles, paid strikebreakers sought out union members and went after them with a professional, methodical violence. The fighting was hand to hand and unforgiving. Six armed U.S. infantry companies had to be deployed on the streets before the bloodshed could be stopped.<br><br>Otis was not deterred. The riots were, he firmly believed, only the opening salvo in a war that would not be over until the unions were driven out of Los Angeles. Compromise would be surrender. Rather than negotiate, he prepared for new battles. He now called himself &#x201c;General.&#x201d; He christened his sprawling home &#x201c;the Bivouac.&#x201d; He mounted a cannon on the hood of his limousine and made sure his chauffeur was prepared to repel, at his command, any enemy attacks. He modeled the paper&#x2019;s new printing plant on a fanciful vision of an impregnable fortress, complete with battlements, sentry boxes, and firing holes offering protected lines of fire at any mob that dared to storm his citadel. Impatient, full of a warrior&#x2019;s gusto, he waited for the conflict he was certain would come.<br><br>His greatest supporter was his son-in-law, Harry Chandler. With unquestioning devotion, Chandler played the roles of ally, confidant, military aide-de-camp, and assistant publisher. He had quit Dartmouth at eighteen and headed west in the hope of curing himself of tuberculosis. Arriving in Los Angeles, he had found work in the Times&#x2019;s circulation department. His rise was meteoric. As Time magazine glibly recounted it, &#x201c;Young Chandler did his job so well that he attracted the General&#x2019;s eye, got a promotion, married the General&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d; The two men were now a team, determined to bring Los Angeles into the new century as a bustling, nonunion metropolis.<br><br>Shrewdly, they recruited supporters. Otis gathered a well-heeled clique of bankers, merchants, and manufacturers into their own anti- union organization&#x2014;the Merchants and Manufacturers Association or, as it became widely known, the M&amp;M.<br><br>From its inception, the M&amp;M was uncompromising. Either employers ran an open shop, or they would suffer consequences. Banks would summarily cut off the credit of offending businesses. Customers would be &#x201c;persuaded&#x201d; to go elsewhere. Organizers from the Citizens&#x2019; Alliance, a national open-shop group, arrived to help the M&amp;M attract members. Within weeks six thousand dues-paying, militant, anti-union employers joined up. The M&amp;M became a powerhouse, and Otis, to his great satisfaction, was its guiding eminence.<br><br>The San Francisco Bulletin accurately captured the organization&#x2019;s spirit and tactics: &#x201c;The Merchants and Manufacturers Association has one confession of faith, one creed: &#x2018;We will employ no union man.&#x2019; The M&amp;M also has one command: &#x2018;You shall employ no union man.&#x2019; The penalty for disobedience to this command is financial coercion, boycott, and ruin.&#x201d; Otis did not disagree with this analysis. In fact, it filled him with pride.<br><br>Meanwhile the unions took anxious measure of the threat aimed at them, and they responded. In 1903 Samuel Gompers&#x2019;s American Federation of Labor (AFL) decided that an active and muscular central union organization was needed to confront the M&amp;M. A Central Labor Council representing every labor group in Los Angeles was formed under the leadership of Patrick McCarthy, a San Francisco labor boss (and later mayor). McCarthy swore to re-create in Los Angeles what he had accomplished up north. San Francisco was a union town; its wages were on the average 30 percent higher than in Los Angeles. He vowed to go head to head against the M&amp;M until workers&#x2019; earnings in the two cities were equal.<br><br>Dozens of strikes broke out. There was a laundry strike, a brewers&#x2019; strike, a bakers&#x2019; strike, a butchers&#x2019; strike. Each unfolded with its own bitter drama. Throughout the city buying a loaf of bread or a pint of beer became an earnest political decision. A customer&#x2019;s sympathies were revealed in nearly every purchase; he was showing either solidarity with labor or support for capital.<br><br>The Times&#x2019;s editorials were shrill and unyielding, each one another hurled epithet. &#x201c;Friends of industrial freedom,&#x201d; went one typically fervent manifesto, &#x201c;must stand together and back the employers who are at present being assaulted by the henchmen of the corrupt San Francisco labor bosses. All decent people must rally around the flag of industrial liberty in this crisis when the welfare of the whole city is at stake. If the San Francisco gorillas succeed, then the brilliant future of Los Angeles will end, business will stagnate; Los Angeles will be another San Francisco&#x2014;dead!&#x201d;</p><h2>German Warplanes of World War II (Combat Aircraft Library)</h2><p>Shows and describes the capabilities of fighters, bombers, reconnaissance craft, and jets used by Nazi Germany during the war</p><p></p><h2>The Fleet Air Arm Handbook 1939-1945</h2><p>The Fleet Air Arm Handbook 1939-45 is the most comprehensive review available of the Royal Navy&#39;s air power during the war years.

In each chapter he summarized the events of one campaign, then added comments from the standpoint of his own military knowledge. Over the nearly two millennia between Caesar and Napoleon some aspects of warfare had changed, notably the introduction of firearms. But much remained the same: the rate of movement of armies (at the foot pace of horse or man); human muscle power as the main source of energy for construction work; some military techniques, notably bridge construction; as well as the actual territory fought over by Caesar and later by Napoleon. Napoleon&#x2019;s commentary thus provides a fascinating and highly authoritative insight into Caesar&#x2019;s wars, as well as providing a window into Napoleon&#x2019;s own thinking and attitudes. Napoleon in places detects mistakes on the part of Caesar and his enemies, and says what they should have done differently. Remarkably, this is thought to be the first full English translation of Napoleon's work.<br><br>Napoleon Bonaparte was born to an obscure Corsican family but rose through the ranks of the French army to become Emperor of France, conqueror of most of Europe and acknowledged military genius.

By turns funny, heartwarming, and occasionally sad, it is the author's account of her marriage to a Scottish landowner and of the years they spent together at "The Guynd," his large ancestral estate. We follow her steep learning curve in dealing with a grand and crumbling mansion still recovering from the effects of two World Wars, as well as an overgrown landscape, a derelict garden, troublesome tenants, local aristocracy, Scottish rituals, and a husband for whom change is anathema.<br><br>A son and heir draws the author into an intimate relationship with every tier of the local society, while a visiting American friend heightens the strain of the ever-present culture gap. Alternating between enchantment and despair, Rathbone digs into family and local history in an effort to understand her surroundings and free her husband from the grip of the past.<br><br>Like a letter home from a strange land, this book offers a view of Scotland not found in the guide books. The tale of the journey through the wrought iron gates and up the long tree-lined drive into the living past is both wry and poignant, both oddball and deeply reflective of the ties that bind us.</p><p><b>Belinda Rathbone</b> is a photography historian who has written widely on modern and contemporary photographers. She is the author of <i>Walker Evans: A Biography</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of 1995. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.As Rathbone tells it, when she got married it wasn't so much to a man as to his ancestral house in Scotland-the Guynd of the title-and the deeply ingrained way of life that came with it. Her attitude toward the enormous project of restoring the manor while also figuring out and trying to fit in with the clannish Scots is at turns enthusiastic and exasperated, and her anecdotes about the renovation, from massive hedge-trimming and garden rehabilitation to a reupholstering undertaking of gargantuan proportions, will have home improvement fanatics mad with jealousy. The writing is vivid, but unlike in her acclaimed 1995 biography of Walker Evans, Rathbone here leaves out much of her interior life, so the reader witnesses, to varying degrees, her disintegrating marriage and the fervor with which she rehabs the old house, but her reticence to turn her gaze inward hampers any emotional connection with the reader. Thoughtful descriptions of her attempts to understand her Scottish neighbors sometimes distract from this, but for the most part she and the narrative are tied to the Guynd, and the result is as frustrating and fascinating for the reader as the actual experience was for her. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

My mum&#x2014;my adoptive mother&#x2014;had put it there to help me feel at home when I arrived from that country at the age of six to live with them in 1987. She had to teach me what the map represented&#x2014;I was completely uneducated. I didn&#x2019;t even know what a map was, let alone the shape of India.</p><p>Mum had decorated the house with Indian objects&#x2014;there were some Hindu statues, brass ornaments and bells, and lots of little elephant figurines. I didn&#x2019;t know then that these weren&#x2019;t normal objects to have in an Australian house. She had also put some Indian printed fabric in my room, across the dresser, and a carved wooden puppet in a brightly colored outfit. All these things seemed sort of familiar, even if I hadn&#x2019;t seen anything exactly like them before. Another adoptive parent might have made the decision that I was young enough to start my life in Australia with a clean slate and could be brought up without much reference to where I&#x2019;d come from. But my skin color would always have given away my origins, and anyway, she and my father chose to adopt a child from India for a reason, as I will go into later.</p><p>The map&#x2019;s hundreds of place-names swam before me throughout my childhood. Long before I could read them, I knew that the immense V of the Indian subcontinent was a place teeming with cities and towns, with deserts and mountains, rivers and forests&#x2014;the Ganges, the Himalayas, tigers, gods!&#x2014;and it came to fascinate me. I would stare up at the map, lost in the thought that somewhere among all those names was the place I had come from, the place of my birth. I knew it was called &#x201c;Ginestlay,&#x201d; but whether that was the name of a city, or a town, or a village, or maybe even a street&#x2014;and where to start looking for it on that map&#x2014;I had no idea.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know for certain how old I was, either. Although official documents showed my birthday as May 22, 1981, the year had been estimated by Indian authorities, and the date in May was the day I had arrived at the orphanage from which I had been offered up for adoption. An uneducated, confused boy, I hadn&#x2019;t been able to explain much about who I was or where I&#x2019;d come from.</p><p>At first, Mum and Dad didn&#x2019;t know how I&#x2019;d become lost. All they knew&#x2014;all anyone knew&#x2014;was that I&#x2019;d been picked off the streets of Calcutta, as it was still known then, and after attempts to find my family had failed, I had been put in the orphanage. Happily for all of us, I was adopted by the Brierleys. So to start with, Mum and Dad would point to Calcutta on my map and tell me that&#x2019;s where I came from&#x2014;but in fact the first time I ever heard the name of that city was when they said it. It wasn&#x2019;t until about a year after I arrived, once I&#x2019;d made some headway with English, that I was able to explain that I didn&#x2019;t come from Calcutta at all&#x2014;a train had taken me there from a train station near &#x201c;Ginestlay.&#x201d; That station might have been called something like &#x201c;Bramapour,&#x201d; &#x201c;Berampur&#x201d; . . . I wasn&#x2019;t sure. All I knew was that it was a long way from Calcutta, and no one had been able to help me find it.</p><p>Of course, when I first arrived in Australia, the emphasis was on the future, not the past. I was being introduced to a new life in a very different world from the one I&#x2019;d been born into, and my new mum and dad were putting a lot of effort into facing the challenges that experience brought. Mum didn&#x2019;t worry too much about my learning English immediately, since she knew it would come through day-to-day use. Rather than trying to rush me into it, she thought it was far more important at the outset to comfort and care for me, and gain my trust. You don&#x2019;t need words for that. She also knew an Indian couple in the neighborhood, Saleen and Jacob, and we would visit them regularly to eat Indian food together. They would speak with me in my own language, Hindi, asking simple questions and translating instructions and things Mum and Dad wanted me to know about how we&#x2019;d live our life together. Being so young when I got lost and coming from a very basic background, I didn&#x2019;t speak much Hindi, either, but being understood by someone was a huge help in becoming comfortable about my new surroundings. Anything my new parents weren&#x2019;t able to communicate through gestures and smiles, we knew Saleen and Jacob could help us with, so we were never stuck.</p><p>I picked up my new language quite quickly, as children often do. But at first I spoke very little about my past in India. My parents didn&#x2019;t want to push me to talk about it until I was ready, and apparently I didn&#x2019;t show many signs that I gave it much thought. Mum remembers a time when I was seven, when out of the blue I got very distressed and cried out, &#x201c;Me begot!&#x201d; Later she found out I was upset that I had forgotten the way to the school near my Indian home, where I used to watch the students. We agreed that it probably didn&#x2019;t matter anymore. But deep down, it mattered to me. My memories were all I had of my past, and privately I thought about them over and over, trying to ensure that I didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;beget.&#x201d;</p><p>In fact, the past was never far from my mind. At night memories would flash by and I&#x2019;d have trouble calming myself so I could sleep. Daytime was generally better, with lots of activity to distract me, but my mind was always busy. As a consequence of this and my determination not to forget, I have always recalled my childhood experiences in India clearly, as an almost complete picture&#x2014;my family, my home, and the traumatic events surrounding my separation from them have remained fresh in my mind, sometimes in great detail. Some of these memories were good, and some of them bad&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t have one without the other, and I couldn&#x2019;t let them go.</p><p>My transition to life in another country and culture wasn&#x2019;t as difficult as one might expect, most likely because, compared to what I&#x2019;d gone through in India, it was obvious that I was better off in Australia. Of course, more than anything I wanted to find my mother again, but once I&#x2019;d realized that was impossible, I knew I had to take whatever opportunity came my way to survive. Mum and Dad were very affectionate, right from the start, always giving me lots of cuddles and making me feel safe, secure, loved, and above all, wanted. That meant a lot to a child who&#x2019;d been lost and had experienced what it was like for no one to care about him. I bonded with them readily, and very soon trusted them completely. Even at the age of six (I would always accept 1981 as the year of my birth), I understood that I had been awarded a rare second chance. I quickly became Saroo Brierley.</p><p>Once I was safe and secure in my new home in Hobart, I thought perhaps it was somehow wrong to dwell on the past&#x2014;that part of the new life was to keep the old locked away&#x2014;so I kept my nighttime thoughts to myself. I didn&#x2019;t have the language to explain them at first anyway. And to some degree, I also wasn&#x2019;t aware of how unusual my story was&#x2014;it was upsetting to me, but I thought it was just the kind of thing that happened to people. It was only later, when I began to open up to people about my experiences, that I knew from their reactions it was out of the ordinary.</p><p>Occasionally the night thoughts would spill over into the day. I remember Mum and Dad taking me to see the Hindi film Salaam Bombay! Its images of the little boy trying to survive alone in a sprawling city, in the hope of returning to his mother, brought back disturbing memories so sharply that I wept in the dark cinema. After that, my parents only took me to fun Bollywood-style movies.</p><p>Even sad music of any kind (though particularly classical) could set off emotional memories, since in India I had often heard music emanating from other people&#x2019;s radios. Seeing or hearing babies cry also affected me strongly, probably because of memories of my little sister, Shekila. The most emotional thing was seeing other families with lots of children. I suppose that, even in my good fortune, they reminded me of what I&#x2019;d lost.</p><p>But eventually I began talking about the past. Only a month or so after my arrival, I described to Saleen my Indian family in outline&#x2014;mother, sister, two brothers&#x2014;and that I&#x2019;d been separated from my brother and become lost. I didn&#x2019;t have the resources to explain too much, and Saleen gently let me lead the story to where I wanted it to go rather than pressing me. Gradually, my English improved; we were speaking Hinglish, but we were all learning. I told Mum and Dad a few more things, like the fact that my father had left the family when I was very little. Most of the time, though, I concentrated on the present: I had started going to school, and I was making new friends and discovering a love of sport.</p><p>Then one wet weekend just over a year after I&#x2019;d arrived in Hobart, I surprised Mum&#x2014;and myself&#x2014;by opening up about my life in India. I&#x2019;d probably come to feel more settled in my new life and now had some words to put to my experiences. I found myself telling her more than ever before about my Indian family: about how we were so poor that we often went hungry, or how my mother would have me go around to people&#x2019;s houses in the neighborhood with a pot to beg for any leftover food. It was an emotional conversation, and Mum held me close during our talk. She suggested that together we draw a map of the place I was from, and as she drew, I pointed out where my family&#x2019;s home was on our street, the way to the river where all the kids played, and the bridge under which you walked to get to the train station. We traced the route with our fingers and then drew the home&#x2019;s layout in detail. We put in where each member of my family slept&#x2014;even the order in which we lay down at night. We returned to the map and refined it as my English improved. But in the whirl of memories brought on by first making that map, I was soon telling Mum about the circumstances of my becoming lost, as she looked at me, amazed, and took notes. She drew a wavy line on the map, pointing to Calcutta, and wrote, &#x201c;A very long journey.&#x201d;</p><p>A couple of months later, we took a trip to Melbourne to visit some other kids who had been adopted from the same Calcutta orphanage as me. Talking enthusiastically in Hindi to my fellow adoptees inevitably brought back the past very vividly. For the first time, I told Mum that the place I was from was called &#x201c;Ginestlay,&#x201d; and when she asked me where I was talking about, I confidently, if a little illogically, replied, &#x201c;You take me there and I&#x2019;ll show you. I know the way.&#x201d;</p><p>Saying aloud the name of my home for the first time since arriving in Australia was like opening a release valve. Soon after that, I told an even more complete version of events to a teacher I liked at school. For over an hour and a half, she wrote notes, too, with that same amazed expression. Strange as I found Australia, for Mum and my teacher, hearing me talk about India must have been like trying to understand things that had occurred on another planet.</p><p>� � �</p><p>The story I told them was about people and places I&#x2019;d turned over in my mind again and again since I arrived in Australia, and which I would continue to think about often as I grew up. Not surprisingly, there are gaps here and there. Sometimes I&#x2019;m unsure of details, such as the order in which incidents occurred, or how many days passed between them. And it can be difficult for me to separate what I thought and felt then, as a child, from what I&#x2019;ve come to think and feel over the course of the twenty-seven years that followed. Although repeated revisiting and searching the past for clues might have disturbed some of the evidence, much of my childhood experience remains vivid in my memory.</p><p>Back then, it was a relief to tell my story, as far as I understood it. Now, since the life-changing events that sparked after my thirtieth birthday, I am excited by the prospect that sharing my experiences might inspire hope in others.</p><p><b>2.</b></p><p><b>Getting Lost</b></p><p>Some of my most vivid memories are the days I spent watching over my baby sister, Shekila, her grubby face smiling up at me as we played peekaboo. She always looked at me with adoring eyes, and it made me feel good to be her protector and hero. In the cooler seasons, Shekila and I spent many nights waiting alone in the chilly house like newly hatched chicks in a nest, wondering if our mother would come home with some food. When no one came, I&#x2019;d get the bedding out&#x2014;just a few ragged sheets&#x2014;and cuddle with her for warmth.</p><p>During the hot months of the year, my family would join the others with whom we shared the house and gather together outside in the courtyard, where someone played the harmonium and others sang. I had a real sense of belonging and well-being on those long, warm nights. If there was any milk, the women would bring it out and we children got to share it. The babies were fed first, and if any was left over, the older ones got a taste. I loved the lingering sensation of its sticky sweetness on my tongue.</p><p>On those evenings I used to gaze upward, amazed at how spectacular the night sky was. Some stars shone brightly in the darkness, while others merely blinked. I wondered why flashes of light would suddenly streak across the sky for no reason at all, making us &#x201c;ooh&#x201d; and &#x201c;aah.&#x201d; Afterward we would all huddle together, bundled up in our bedding on the hard ground, before closing our eyes in sleep.</p><p>That was in our first house, where I was born, which we shared with another Hindu family. Each group had their own side of a large central room, with brick walls and an unsealed floor made of cowpats and mud. It was very simple but certainly no chawl&#x2014;those warrens of slums where the unfortunate families of the megacities like Mumbai and Delhi find themselves living. Despite the closeness of the quarters, we all got along. My memories of this time are some of my happiest.</p><p>My mother, Kamla, was a Hindu and my father a Muslim&#x2014;an unusual marriage at the time, and one that didn&#x2019;t last long. My father spent very little time with us (I later discovered he had taken a second wife), and so my mother raised us by herself.</p><p>My mother was very beautiful, slender, with long, lustrous black hair&#x2014;I remember her as the loveliest woman in the world. She had broad shoulders, and limbs made of iron from all her hard work. Her hands and face were tattooed, as was the custom, and most of the time she wore a red sari. I don&#x2019;t remember much about my father, since I only saw him a few times. I do recall that he wore white from top to bottom, his face was square and broad, and his curly dark hair was sprinkled with gray.</p><p>As well as my mother and my baby sister, Shekila, whose name was Muslim unlike ours, there were also my older brothers, Guddu and Kallu, whom I loved and looked up to. Guddu was tall and slim, with curly black hair down to his shoulders. He was light-skinned, and his face resembled my mother&#x2019;s. Usually he wore short shorts and a white shirt&#x2014;all our clothes were hand-me-downs from the neighbors, but because of the heat we didn&#x2019;t need much. Kallu was heavier than Guddu, broad from top to bottom, with thin hair. On the other hand, I had short, straight, thick hair, and I was extremely skinny as a child; my face resembled my father&#x2019;s more than my mother&#x2019;s.</p><p>When my father did live with us, he could be violent, taking his frustr...</p></p><h2>Brilliant Waters: Portraits of Lake Tahoe, Yosemite, and the High Sierra</h2><p>Brilliant Waters combines Elizabeth Carmel&#39;s stunning landscape photography with a wonderful selection of moving poetry.

In particular, Jacoby traces the demise of liberal and leftist politics. Leftist intellectuals and critics no longer envision a different society, only a modified one. The left once dismissed the market as exploitative, but now honors it as rational and humane. The left used to disdain mass culture, but now celebrates it as rebellious. The left once rejected pluralism as superficial, but now resurrects pluralist ideas in the guise of multiculturalism.Ranging across a wide terrain of cultural and political phenomena&#x2014;the end of the Cold War, the rise of multiculturalism, the acceptance of mass culture, the eclipse of independent intellectuals&#x2014;Jacoby documents and laments a widespread retreat from the utopian spirit that has always been the engine for social and political change.</p><p>The near-total triumph of free market capitalism around the world has put a damper on utopian visions, leading many politicians and activists to believe that radical change is impossible, that at best one can hope for slight modifications of the status quo. For Russell Jacoby, this attitude is not so much the result of practicality as it is the product of exhaustion, and he argues that as a society we can do <i>much</i> better. <i>The End of Utopia</i> is an uncompromising look at the intellectual caliber of late-20th-century liberal and leftist politics, particularly within the academy. He portrays the class of professional intellectuals as insiders adopting the pose of marginality, and lambastes the current practitioners of "cultural studies" in particular for their tendency toward banal "analysis" of mass culture in tortured, jargon-laced prose. (In contrast, he holds up Dwight Macdonald, Theodor Adorno, and Matthew Arnold as writers who have addressed mass culture in plain language yet with deep, critical intelligence.) And he proposes that multiculturalism may be little more than a last-ditch attempt at differentiation within the one, dominant culture. "What is to be done?" he asks after cataloguing this state of affairs. "The question, routinely addressed to all critics, insists on a practicality inimical to utopianism. Nothing is to be done. Yet that does not mean nothing is to be thought or imagined or dreamed." <i>The End of Utopia</i> shows to what extent the dreams have been abandoned, with the means of rekindling them yet within grasp.Russell Jacoby is a professor of history and education at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of several books of political and cultural criticism.</p><h2>Detective Stories (Red Hot Reads)</h2><p><p>Young mystery fans will be enthralled by this compelling volume of detective fiction that includes both classic and contemporary writers such as Italo Calvino, Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Damon Runyon, and Andrew Vachss.</p></p><p><p>Philip Pullman is an award-winning writer who has won critical aclaim. His novel, Northern Lights (the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy) was published in the US as an adult novel under the title The Golden Compass. In the UK, Northern Lights won the Carnegie Medal, the Guardian Children's Fiction Award and the Children's Book of the Year Award, while in the US it was one of four honor children's books at the ABBY awards. Previous novels have included The Ruby in the Smoke, winner of the International Reading Association Award and recommended in the New York Times Parents Guide to the Best Books for Children, and Tiger in the Well, shortlisted for the Guardian Award. A former teacher, Philip Pullman writes in a garden shed at the bottom of his garden near Oxford, England. A passionate advocate of children's literature he has said " . . . stories are vital. There's more wisdom in a story than in volumes of philosophy, and there's a hunger for stories in all of us."</p>Grade 9 Up-An unusual and uneven collection of tales from across the past century, though most date to the first half of that period. Authors include masters such as Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie and lesser known or newer writers such as Andrew Vachss and Raymond Smullyan. In addition, Pullman has chosen the work of some authors not normally considered "detective" writers at all-Isaac Asimov, Italo Calvino, Damon Runyon. All of the selections are well written and plotted, and are overwhelmingly selected from authors writing for adults. Herein lies the unevenness. The styles of the various authors and the ages of their characters should pose little problem for young adults who like to read. Why then, one wonders, has Pullman included chapters from Emil and the Detectives, which are both inconclusive as selected and too childish to be enjoyed by most of the seemingly intended audience? One likewise questions the inclusion of "Murder at St. Oswald's," set in a British boys' school among "middle school" students whose behavior seems about on par with American sixth graders. On the other hand, older readers can simply skip these entries and enjoy instead what is likely to be their first exposure to Runyon, Calvino, Vachss, and Dorothy Sayers. The inclusion of one "true story," Tony Fletcher's "Fingerprinting a Ghost," is both a marvelous idea and a marvelous choice.<br><i>Coop Renner, Coldwell Elementary-Intermediate School, El Paso, TX</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Essential Oils: The Complete Guide to the Use of Aromatic Oils in Aromatherapy, Herbalism, Health, and Well-Being</h2><p>&#34;At last a clear and systematic distillation of useful information about a truly comprehensive spectrum of essential oils and absolutes.&#34; -John Steele, American Aromatherapy Association &#34;A comprehensive and timely contribution to aromatherapy, herbalism and the whole field of holistic health care.

These include state-of-the-art DNA testing on various materials, computer enhancement of watermarks and expert examinations of hand-writing, paper, inks and other relics. She also uses her knowledge of profiling on the possible suspects, as well as consulting experts in the field. On presenting her conclusions to a very senior Metropolitan Police officer she learns that had the investigators of the time been presented with the facts she has unearthed, her suspect would definitely have been arrested and would probably have faced trial. Naming the killer as the artist, Walter Sickert, Cornwell details the reasons and evidence for this conclusion.</p><p>Patricia Cornwell&#39;s first novel was published in 1990. Since then she and her creation, Kay Scarpetta, have become household names. She has helped to establish the Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine and serves as its Chairman of the Board.Monday, August 6, 1888, was a bank holiday in London.

He was a painter, an etcher, a student of</p><p>James McNeill Whistler, and a disciple of Edgar Degas. Young Sickert</p><p>was himself a work of art: slender, with a strong upper body from swimming,</p><p>a perfectly angled nose and jaw, thick wavy blond hair, and blue</p><p>eyes that were as inscrutable and penetrating as his secret thoughts and</p><p>piercing mind. One might almost have called him pretty, except for his</p><p>mouth, which could narrow into a hard, cruel line. His precise height is</p><p>unknown, but a friend of his described him as a little above average. Photographs</p><p>and several items of clothing donated to the Tate Gallery</p><p>Archive in the 1980s suggest he was probably five foot eight or nine.</p><p>Sickert was fluent in German, English, French, and Italian. He knew</p><p>Latin well enough to teach it to friends, and he was well acquainted with</p><p>Danish and Greek and possibly knew a smattering of Spanish and Portuguese.</p><p>He was said to read the classics in their original languages, but</p><p>he didn&#x2019;t always finish a book once he started it. It wasn&#x2019;t uncommon to</p><p>find dozens of novels strewn about, opened to the last page that had</p><p>snagged his interest. Mostly, Sickert was addicted to newspapers,</p><p>tabloids, and journals.</p><p>Until his death in 1942, his studios and studies looked like a recycling</p><p>center for just about every bit of newsprint to roll off the European</p><p>P A T R I C I A C O R N W E L L</p><p>[ 2 ]</p><p>presses. One might ask how any hard-working person could find time to</p><p>go through four, five, six, ten newspapers a day, but Sickert had a</p><p>method. He didn&#x2019;t bother with what didn&#x2019;t interest him, whether it was</p><p>politics, economics, world affairs, wars, or people. Nothing mattered to</p><p>Sickert unless it somehow affected Sickert.</p><p>He usually preferred to read about the latest entertainment to come</p><p>to town, to scrutinize art critiques, to turn quickly to any story about</p><p>crime, and to search for his own name if there was any reason it might</p><p>be in print on a given day. He was fond of letters to the editor, especially</p><p>ones he wrote and signed with a pseudonym. Sickert relished knowing</p><p>what other people were doing, especially in the privacy of their own notalways-</p><p>so-tidy Victorian lives. &#x201c;Write, write, write!&#x201d; he would beg his</p><p>friends. &#x201c;Tell me in detail all sorts of things, things that have amused you</p><p>and how and when and where, and all sorts of gossip about every one.&#x201d;</p><p>Sickert despised the upper class, but he was a star stalker. He somehow</p><p>managed to hobnob with the major celebrities of the day: Henry Irving</p><p>and Ellen Terry, Aubrey Beardsley, Henry James, Max Beerbohm,</p><p>Oscar Wilde, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Rodin, Andr� Gide, �douard Dujardin,</p><p>Proust, Members of Parliament. But he did not necessarily know</p><p>many of them, and no one famous or otherwise ever really knew him.</p><p>Not even his first wife, Ellen, who would turn forty in less than two</p><p>weeks. Sickert may not have given much thought to his wife&#x2019;s birthday</p><p>on this bank holiday, but it was extremely unlikely he had forgotten it.</p><p>He was much admired for his amazing memory. Throughout his life</p><p>he would amuse dinner guests by performing long passages of musicals</p><p>and plays, dressed for the parts, his recitations flawless. Sickert would</p><p>not have forgotten that Ellen&#x2019;s birthday was August 18th and a very easy</p><p>occasion to ruin. Maybe he would &#x201c;forget.&#x201d; Maybe he would vanish into</p><p>one of his secret rented hovels that he called studios. Maybe he would</p><p>take Ellen to a romantic caf� in Soho and leave her alone at the table</p><p>while he dashed off to a music hall and then stayed out the rest of the</p><p>night.

He</p><p>had a great range of voice and was a master of greasepaint and wardrobe.</p><p>So gifted at disguise was he that as a boy he often went about unrecognized</p><p>by his neighbors and family.</p><p>Throughout his long and celebrated life, he was notorious for constantly</p><p>changing his appearance with a variety of beards and mustaches,</p><p>for his bizarre dress that in some cases constituted costumes, for his hairstyles </p><p>including shaving his head.

By the time of Whistler&#x2019;s</p><p>engagement their friendship had cooled, but Sickert could not have been</p><p>prepared for what must have seemed a shockingly unexpected and complete</p><p>abandonment by the Master he idolized, envied, and hated.</p><p>Whistler and his new bride planned to honeymoon and travel the rest of</p><p>the year in France, where they hoped to reside permanently.</p><p>The anticipated connubial bliss of the flamboyant artistic genius and</p><p>egocentric James McNeill Whistler must have been disconcerting to his</p><p>former errand boy&#x2013;apprentice. One of Sickert&#x2019;s many roles was the irresistible</p><p>womanizer, but offstage he was nothing of the sort. Sickert was</p><p>dependent on women and loathed them. They were intellectually inferior</p><p>and useless except as caretakers or objects to manipulate, especially for</p><p>art or money. Women were a dangerous reminder of an infuriating and</p><p>humiliating secret that Sickert carried not only to the grave but beyond</p><p>it, because cremated bodies reveal no tales of the flesh, even if they are</p><p>exhumed. Sickert was born with a deformity of his penis requiring surgeries</p><p>when he was a toddler that would have left him disfigured if not</p><p>mutilated. He probably was incapable of an erection. He may not have</p><p>had enough of a penis left for penetration, and it is quite possible he had</p><p>to squat like a woman to urinate.</p><p>&#x201c;My theory of the crimes is that the criminal has been badly disfigured,&#x201d;</p><p>says an October 4, 1888, letter filed with the Whitechapel Murders</p><p>papers at the Corporation of London Records Office, &#x201c; possibly</p><p>P O R T R A I T O F A K I L L E R</p><p>[ 5 ]</p><p>had his privy member destroyed &amp; he is now revenging himself on the</p><p>sex by these atrocities.&#x201d; The letter is written in purple pencil and enigmatically</p><p>signed &#x201c;Scotus,&#x201d; which could be the Latin for Scotsman.</p><p>&#x201c;Scotch&#x201d; can mean a shallow incision or to cut. Scotus could also be a</p><p>strange and erudite reference to Johannes Scotus Eriugena, a ninthcentury</p><p>theologian and teacher of grammar and dialectics.</p><p>For Walter Sickert to imagine Whistler in love and enjoying a sexual</p><p>relationship with a woman might well have been the catalyst that made</p><p>Sickert one of the most dangerous and confounding killers of all time.</p><p>He began to act out what he had scripted most of his life, not only in</p><p>thought but in boyhood sketches that depicted women being abducted,</p><p>tied up, and stabbed.</p><p>The psychology of a violent, remorseless murderer is not defined by</p><p>connecting dots. There are no facile explanations or infallible sequences</p><p>of cause and effect.

As a teenager,</p><p>he had stalked her and her acting partner, Henry Irving. Now Whistler</p><p>had links to not one but both objects of Sickert&#x2019;s obsessions, and these</p><p>three stars in Sickert&#x2019;s universe formed a constellation that did not include</p><p>him. The stars cared nothing about him.

Speculations have shown up in magazines, documentaries, popular fiction, and even on the big screen. Much of the controversy stems from a library of ancient texts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt. Now revolutionary questions about the Christian faith are being raised as a result of these findings:</p><ul><li>Is Jesus truly a divine Savior or just a teacher of wisdom?</li><li>Is orthodoxy a by-product of third-century or fourth-century theologians?</li><li>Did Judas betray Jesus because of evil intent or a request by Jesus?</li><li>Does salvation include the physical body or just the soul?</li></ul><p>Darrell L. Bock takes you on a tour of the new claims as well as the controversial writings, examining their origins and comparing them with traditional sources. With discussion questions for group or individual study at the end of each chapter, <i>The Missing Gospels</i> will help you understand the messages of all of these writings so you can form your own opinion. This provocative work could even change what you believe!</p></p><p>Darrell L. Bock (PhD, University of Aberdeen) is research professor of New Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary. Known for his work in Luke-Acts, Dr. Bock is a Humboldt Scholar (Tubingen University in Germany), an editor-at-large for Christianity Today, and a past president of the Evangelical Theological Society (2000-2001). A New York Times bestselling author, Bock has written over thirty books, including Luke in the NIV Application Commentary series.The wild success of Dan Brown's <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has spawned a thriving cottage industry of both supporters and critics. One of Brown's more controversial assertions is that the emergence of Christian orthodoxy was based not on its merit but on the politics of the winning side. Here, Bock sums up the evangelical perspective as he challenges the idea that orthodoxy "emerged" at all. Rather, he argues, it survived its many challenges in the early centuries of the Christian church because it best reflected the thoughts and teachings of Jesus and the apostles. The author, who teaches New Testament at Dallas Theological Seminary, considers the idea that Christianity needs to be "reimagined"&#x2014;reformed in the image of recent archeological and literary discoveries&#x2014;to be an ill-advised attempt to rewrite history. He takes on those scholars who want to reinterpret Christianity in light of early Gnostic teachings that denied the oneness of the Father and the Son and spiritualized the gospel stories into myths. Bock recognizes this is pretty sophisticated stuff, and offers the reader a helpful chapter outlining times, names and ideas, providing a useful framework for the rest of his book. While not conclusively proving his thesis, Bock does provide a lively and readable survey of competing beliefs in Christianity's earliest days. <i>(Aug. 8)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set in 1510, Harrison's excellent fifth Irish historical (after 2009's <i>Writ in Stone</i>) finds series heroine Mara, the <i>brehon</i> of the kingdom of the Burren who serves both as an investigating magistrate and law school professor, married to King Turlough Donn and expecting his child. When two strangers arrive from the Aran Islands to announce that one of them, 20-year-old Iarla, is the previously unknown son of local noble Ardal O'Lochlainn, they cite as evidence the dying confession of Iarla's mother. That statement, under existing law, is considered the most sacred of deathbed oaths. Since Iarla and Ardal don't resemble each other, Mara decides to wait two weeks before rendering her verdict on their relationship. Soon afterward, someone kills Iarla by poking a knife or stick into one of his eyes, leaving the body outside a cave reputed to be the home of a malevolent one-eyed god. Harrison smoothly integrates the legal system of 16th-century Ireland into the story line. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He had arrived in Los Angeles more than twenty years earlier, but he recounted his losses as vividly as though they had occurred just recently. The greatest loss was his separation from Anita Gonzales, by his own account "the only woman I ever loved," to whom he left almost all of his royalties in his will.<br><br>In <i>Dead Man Blues, </i>Phil Pastras sets the record straight on the two periods (1917-1923 and 1940-1941) that Jelly Roll Morton spent on the West Coast. In addition to rechecking sources, correcting mistakes in scholarly accounts, and situating eyewitness narratives within the histories of New Orleans or Los Angeles, Pastras offers a fresh interpretation of the life and work of Morton, one of the most important and influential early practitioners of jazz. Pastras's discovery of a previously unknown collection of memorabilia&#x2014;including a 58-page scrapbook compiled by Morton himself&#x2014;sheds new light on Morton's personal and artistic development, as well as on the crucial role played by Anita Gonzales.<br><br>In a rich, fast-moving, and fascinating narrative, Pastras traces Morton's artistic development as a pianist, composer, and bandleader. Among many other topics, Pastras discusses the complexities of racial identity for Morton and his circle, his belief in voodoo, his relationships with women, his style of performance, and his roots in black musical traditions. Not only does <i>Dead Man Blues </i>restore to the historical record invaluable information about one of the great innovators of jazz, it also brings to life one of the most colorful and fascinating periods of musical transformation on the West Coast.</p><p>"It is hard to say which makes for the more compelling narrative: the life of jazz great Jelly Roll Morton or the detective work that Phil Pastras undertook in putting together this engaging book. <i>Dead Man Blues</i> tells both these tales admirably, drawing on a treasure-trove of previously unknown material. It is both an important contribution to jazz scholarship and a fascinating piece of storytelling."&#x2014;Ted Gioia, author of <i>The History of Jazz and West Coast Jazz</i><br><br>"Meticulously researched, including primary source material recently uncovered by the author, <i>Dead Man Blues</i> is not only a masterfully written, definitive account of Jelly Roll Morton's west coast years, but also a penetrating psychological and social study of the man and the forces that drove and shaped him."&#x2014;Steve Isoardi, co-author of <i>Central Avenue Sounds</i><br><br>"A must-read for all jazz aficionados."&#x2014;Gerald Wilson<br><br>"One of the best books ever written about Jelly Roll Morton."&#x2014;Gerald Wiggins, jazz pianist<b>Phil Pastras </b>is Assistant Professor of English at Pasadena City College and coeditor and cotranslator of <i>The New Oresteia of Yannis Ritsos </i>(1991).</p><h2>Surprise Endings (The Christy Miller Series #4)</h2><p>Although her parents still refuse to allow her to date, Christy accepts both of the invitations she receives to the high school prom, determined to follow the whims of her heart, even if they lead her away from God.

Instead, he is soon to learn of Lord Dunmore's proclamation offering freedom to slaves who join the counterrevolutionary forces. <br><br>In Volume II of his unparalleled masterwork, M. T. Anderson recounts Octavian's experiences as the Revolutionary War explodes around him, thrusting him into intense battles and tantalizing him with elusive visions of liberty. Ultimately, this astonishing narrative escalates to a startling, deeply satisfying climax, while reexamining our national origins in a singularly provocative light.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2008</strong>: With the publication of <em>The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, Volume I</em> back in 2006, M.T. Anderson assured readers that his gripping account of the American Revolution from the perspective of a young slave in colonial Boston would continue. Volume I received the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, and the anticipation among critics and readers inevitably grew for the story to continue. Thankfully, Anderson is a man of his word. With <em>The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, Volume II: The Kingdom on the Waves</em> Anderson has not just delivered an equally haunting second and final act to his hero's story, he's also completed a literary masterpiece that simply blows away its limited categorization as Young Adult lit. <em>Octavian II</em> engages the reader (teenaged or otherwise) to reimagine the birth of the nation from an unfamiliar perspective--that of an African American slave compelled by incredible circumstance, and the hope of freedom, to fight in a counterrevolutionary army. No less than David McCullough and Joseph Ellis, Anderson turns everything you thought you knew about American history sideways. Through his expert incorporation of historical detail and colonial-era voice, the novel transports us deep into the perilous military and moral battles that defined the American Revolution. That these historical conflicts continue to inform today's charged debates about national identity and purpose makes his novels all the more relevant and powerful. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><br> <p><strong> Read a Letter from the Author on What Inspired <em>The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing</em> </strong><br> (CLICK on Image to Enlarge)<br></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p>&#34;A sweeping and epic novel...will someday be recognized as a novel of the first rank, the kind of monumental work Italo Calvino called &#39;encyclopedic&#39; in the way it sweeps up history into a comprehensive and deeply textured pattern.&#34;</p><h2>Hodaka Motorcycles Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Hodaka motorcycles were some of the most creatively marketed and designed motorcycles in America.

We're going to start at death, but then we're going to double back and go all the way through an emergency room (where they know me), through Watergate, back through Vietnam to birth. My birth. </p><p> I was born on October 21, 1956. This makes me quite old -- half a century and change. I was born in Burbank, California...to simple folk. People of the land. No, actually my father was a famous singer, and you wanna hear something really cool? My mother is a movie star. She's an icon. A gay icon, but you take your iconic stature where you can. His name is Eddie Fisher, and her name is Debbie Reynolds. My parents had this incredibly vital relationship with an audience, like with muscle and blood. This was the main competition I had for my parents' attention, an audience. People like you. You know who you are. </p><p> My father had many big songs, but perhaps the one he's best remembered for was "Oh! My Papa," which I like to call "Oh! My Faux Pas." And my mother, well, she did tons and tons of films, but I think the one she's best remembered for is the classic film <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i> But she was also nominated for an Oscar for best actress for her role in <i>The Unsinkable Molly Brown</i> but tragically, she lost to Julie Andrews, for her stunning, layered, and moving portrait of <i>Mary Poppins.</i> Ibsen's Mary Poppins, of course. </p><p> My mother was also in another film called <i>Tammy,</i> which was also a hit song -- which pissed off my father because that was really his area. She was actually pregnant with me when she filmed <i>Tammy.</i> So if you look very carefully, there's a scene where she and Leslie Nielsen are in the garden trying to save some prize tomatoes in a rainstorm (like they do in old movies). Well, I am the bulge in the side of her abdomen. It's some of my best screen work; I urge you to see it. Oh, and she was also pregnant with me in yet another film called <i>A Bundle of Joy,</i> costarring the marvelous method actor -- Eddie Fisher. </p><p> When I was born, my mother was given anesthesia because in those days they didn't have epidurals. (I always thought that they should make an epidural that works from the neck up, which was a condition I aspired to for most of what I laughingly refer to as my adult life.) Anyway, so my mother was unconscious. Now my mother is a beautiful woman -- she's beautiful today in her 70's so at 24 she looked like a Christmas morning. So all the doctors were all buzzing around her pretty head, saying "Oh, look at Debbie Reynolds asleep -- how pretty." And my father, upon seeing me start to come through -- crown with all the placenta and everything else (ugh) -- my father fainted dead away. So now all the nurses ran over to him, saying "Oh look, there's Eddie Fisher, the crooner, on the ground! Let's go look at him!" So when I arrived, I was virtually unattended! And I have been trying to make up for that fact ever since. Even this book is a pathetic bid for the attention I lacked as a newborn. </p><p> My father was best friends with a very charismatic producer named Mike Todd, who produced a movie called <i>Around the World in Eighty Days,</i> which won an Oscar for Best Picture. </p><p> So my father and mother and Mike Todd and his fianc�e, who happened to be Elizabeth Taylor, went everywhere together -- they went to nightclubs, on cruises -- well, they literally traveled the world! So when Mike and Elizabeth got married, my father was Mike Todd's best man and my mother was Elizabeth's matron of honor! She even washed her hair on her wedding day. Now later I heard my mother mumble that she wished she washed it with Nair. But she's not a bitter woman. </p><p> Anyway, I was about two when my brother was born, and my father so adored Mike Todd that my brother, Todd, was named for him. </p><p> Now, perhaps my father didn't realize that in the Jewish faith, it is considered bad luck to name a child after someone who is still living -- a silly superstition -- or so they thought! </p><p> Because about a year later, Mike Todd took off in a private plane in a rainstorm, and the following morning Elizabeth was a widow. Well, naturally, my father flew to Elizabeth's side, gradually making his way slowly to her front. He first dried her eyes with his handkerchief, then he consoled her with flowers, and he ultimately consoled her with his penis. Now this made marriage to my mother awkward, so he was gone within the week. And as far as I know he has not returned. Up to this very day. But you know what? I have high hopes because I think one night they are both going to come see my show on the same night, run into each other, get that old feeling, get back together, and raise me right! </p><p> You might be thinking, well, that explains it! She's the product of Hollywood inbreeding. That's why my skull isn't entirely grown together at the back. </p><p> Recently, my daughter, Billie, who is sixteen now, had a flirtation with Mike Todd and Elizabeth's grandson Rhys. When they first met, they were trying to work out how it all fit together and if they were related in some way. So I thought about it. And when I think, I need an enormous chalkboard with a chart to hold my thoughts...because I have so many zooming this way and that and then it's helpful if I can have some pictures and a pen so I can organize the insanity that is my thought process. </p><p> Welcome, class, to Hollywood 101. Thank you so much for enrolling. </p><p> Alright, so up at the top left of the chart, we have Eddie and Debbie. In the '50s they were known as "America's Sweethearts." Now if you are too young to relate to any of this, try and think of it this way: think of Eddie as Brad Pitt and Debbie as Jennifer Aniston and Elizabeth as Angelina Jolie. Does that help? </p><p> All right, so Eddie consoles Elizabeth with his penis, Elizabeth takes a movie in Rome -- a big budget film called <i>Cleopatra</i> and she meets her costar Richard Burton, so goodbye, Eddie, hello, Richard. </p><p> These two hit it off like gangbusters (whatever that means) and they met and married and had a wild, passionate relationship with violet eyes and Welsh accents and acting and diamonds and drinking, dancing and sex and joy and love. But ultimately, you know, with passionate relationships, they can become stormy, and then what do you think happens? That's right...they get divorced...but they have good memories of one another, so what do they do then? They remarry, that's right. Now, keep that in mind, because it might come up again. </p><p> All right, now let's go to Debbie. Now Debbie does not want to marry another man who will run off, so she marries someone very, very old who <i>can't</i> run -- nope, Harry Karl can't run at all. All he does is sit in a chair and smoke and drink and read the paper, and after about thirteen years, he loses all his money, and then he takes all of hers. Fun! And so that marriage ends. And she was alone for a while, but then fate intervened and brought her this sociopath -- Richard Hamlett. He has some money issues, too. Her money. </p><p> But let's not get too far past Harry Karl though. My first stepfather. Harry was a shoe tycoon. It doesn't sound like those words should fit together, does it? But in this case they do. So, prior to being married to my mother, Harry was married to Marie McDonald. Marie "the Body" McDonald. Now Marie was an actress(ish) and she and Harry met and they married and they had a wild, passionate relationship with bodies and shoes and drinking and dancing and lust and joy and fun. But here come the storm clouds. So what do you think they do then? </p><p> That's right, they do divorce. </p><p> But, they have good memories of each other, so now what do they do? </p><p> That's right, they do remarry and now they have that great American institution -- they have make-up sex, which, as everyone knows, is the best sex of all, and they celebrate the great sex by having a child. And that goes so well that they adopt two more. But then the storm clouds come, so they...? </p><p> Divorce. </p><p> Now, Marie MacDonald was a real romantic, an optimistic woman -- and I say that because she married a grand total of <i>nine</i> times, which is a record for the board. And that's saying something, because this is a marrying board. </p><p> Now, that many marriages could give you a headache, no? Well, I think it gave Marie one because she became addicted to pain killers. Recently I learned this amazing thing. If you become addicted to pain killers, it can go very, very wrong for you. Who knew? Anyway, it did with Marie because she overdosed and passed away. And that last husband, not to be outdone, shot himself. </p><p> You might say they loved each other to death. </p><p> So now there are three children left. What should we do with them? I know! Let's send them to Harry and Debbie. Now, Debbie is told that one of the children should be institutionalized. But my mother is a good person, much like Sarah Palin (only smarter), and she says, "Absolutely not. We will put her in Carrie's room!" </p><p> (Sure, it's funny <i>now.)</i> </p><p> Now, Eddie. Poor Eddie. How is he going to follow an act like Elizabeth Taylor? Well, he manages somehow. He meets a blond, cute, perky, fun, little actress. Sound familiar? </p><p> No, it's not Debbie again. It's a tribute to Debbie. It's Connie Stevens! They meet and have Joely Fisher, from sitcoms, and Tricia Fisher, from New York. </p><p> Oh, wait a minute -- did Eddie forget to marry Connie? </p><p> He did! He forgot to marry her. But eventually they remember. So they get married. But as many people know, legal sex is just shite compared to that premarital stuff that so many couples have in cars, so they divorce. But don't worry, Eddie's not alone for long because now he meets and marries Miss Louisiana! She's three years older than me and she calls me "Dear," which I love. I love it! Now I thought this relationship would go on and on and on because Louisiana is in her early twenties and Eddie is in his late fifties, so she had so many years to devote to him. But what do you think happens? </p><p> Yup, they divorce. I wa...</p></p><h2>The Biodynamic Food and Cookbook: Real Nutrition that Doesn&#x2019;t Cost the Earth</h2><p>Biodynamics is about respect for nature, sustainability, and spiritual ecology.

Nonetheless, biodynamic agriculture had a humble beginning in 1924, with a small group of farmers and gardeners gathered to hear Rudolf Steiner give a series of lectures on revitalizing agriculture. It was a time of growing interest in industrial farming and mass production, and Steiner spoke of the need to preserve and nurture the qualitative aspects of food. He outlined an agricultural method based on a holistic perception of nature. <br><br> Illustrated with hundreds of color photographs, <i><b>The Biodynamic Food &amp; Cookbook</b></i> explains the principles behind biodynamic methods and places it in the context of food and cooking through the ages. Wendy Cook, author of the bestselling <b><i>Foodwise,</i></b> takes us on a journey through the four seasons with more than 150 delicious recipes based on many years of working with biodynamic nutrition. She considers the ethics of food, the foundation of a balanced diet, and conjures up the color and vibrancy of Mallorca, which has contributed so much to her personal approach. Included are supplementary sections on breads, sauces, salads, desserts, drinks, and much more. <br><br> <i><b>The Biodynamic Food &amp; Cookbook</b></i> will find a permanent place in every healthy kitchen.</p><p><b>Wendy E.

That&#39;s why Christopher Columbus signs him on as part of his crew of the Santa Maria. The young Pedro records his adventures in a journal, where he also keeps sketches of what he sees during the treacherous journey across the Atlantic. Award-winning author Pam Conrad and illustrator Peter Koeppen create a thrilling and believable re-creation of one boy&#39;s account of this epic voyage.</p><p><b>Pam Conrad (deceased) </b>has written many outstanding novels for young people, including <i>Stonewords </i>and <i>Prairie Songs, </i>which won the 1986 International Reading Association's Children's Book Award.<br><br><b>Peter Koeppen (deceased) </b>is the illustrator of <i>A&nbsp;Swinger of Birches: Poems of Robert Frost for Young People, </i>which became an American Book Awards Nominee.Grade 3-6-- Pedro, one of three ship's boys on board the Santa Maria, acknowledges that he was hired on not for his seamanship, but for his ability to read and write. Conrad uses the device of a journal to tell of his adventures with Columbus, a man whom Pedro admires, but who also engages in fiery rages and penitent Hail Marys. The details of mutinous murmurings, falling stars, and false land sightings that are described in Susan Martin's I Sailed with Columbus (Overlook, 1991), Miriam Schlein's I Sailed with Columbus (HarperCollins, 1991), and Genevieve O'Connor's The Admiral and the Deck Boy (Shoe Tree, 1991) appear in this narrative as well, but in a tighter, more concise telling. Pedro's journal is a vivid revelation of the details of the voyage as well as the time period. Readers see the boy's discomfort in the explorer's proprietary treatment of the natives and, in particular, his shame that these people are allowed to believe that the Spaniards are deities. Koeppen's line drawings, many of the ships and their equippage, add dimension to the plot. One of the most pleasing of this season's Columbus offerings, Conrad's story will serve as an attractive alternative to nonfiction reading on the subject and certainly as a read-aloud. --Sylvia V.

Really a sequence of autobiographical essays, the book mostly concerns how Cooper's experience of being gay has affected him throughout his life. The life in question is superficially ordinary: Cooper grew up middle-class and vaguely Jewish in Los Angeles in the '60s, the only child of a divorce lawyer and a housewife; he went to college and eventually began teaching literature. Although chronologically ordered, the chapters sometimes leap decades to draw thematic connections and reinforce emotional epiphanies. At the end of a chapter about his childhood entitled ``Imitation of Life,'' for instance, Cooper recalls strolling West Hollywood's exuberant gay strip one night in his 25th year at the moment that, unbeknownst to him, his mother died in bed. Capturing perfectly the simultaneous tragedy and thrill of the moment, he concludes with heartbreaking grace: ``The night was warm, impending, alive, as if longing itself were an aspect of the air, like humidity or wind.'' Cooper's tales of youth, particularly one about disposing of a cache of pornography, can be very funny as well as psychologically astute. When he covers common markers of the gay experience, from adolescent crushes and coming out to therapy and the gym, he avoids clich&#x201a;s entirely; several splendid passages, such as one about an affair with a stand-up comic who gradually spiraled downward into mental illness, read like tragicomic fiction. Great set pieces abound, as when he and his widower father find themselves equally incapable of open discussion about their romantic lives. And Cooper's account of how AIDS has entered his life is as honest and unsparing as any yet written. Recalling his impressions with what feels like uncanny accuracy, Cooper at once inhabits his memories and reshapes them with detachment. This is exhilarating writing. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Cooper's memoir of growing up gay in Los Angeles has at its center the title piece, "Truth Serum," and it is Cooper at his best: exquisite, funny, wise and blessed with a novelist's gift for the epiphanic image. The sodium Pentothol and amphetamine "cocktail" administered to Cooper by his therapist so that he can reduce his attraction to men ironically empowers him to accept his homosexuality, which he does while huddling out of the rain in a doorway in Greenwich Village, newly emboldened to leave his girlfriend. Cooper is a likable sort, and very bright company, if a bit solipsistic (though he is often a solipsist in a sea of narcissists). But the aftereffects of the sodium Pentothol manage to pervade the whole book: it is endlessly chatty and rambling and makes the deadly assumption that an emotional life is necessarily interesting once expressed. And the corollary assumption, that such expression is heroic because it is in a homosexual key, grates. Still, Cooper's writing talent (he wrote the well-received novel A Year of Rhymes) and his alert and often graphic portrait of gay life among professionals in L.A. will find its appreciative readers. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dialogues on Miracle</h2><p>This book explores, in a manner that is readily accessible to those with little or no formal training in philosophy or theology, important questions concerning the rationality of belief in miracles. This book employs the time-honored literary device of dialogue, a practice that dates as far back as Plato. Done well, this form of philosophical investigation puts forward a thesis, yet genuinely engages with the views its author opposes. These dialogues are intended to provide a philosophical defense of the possibility of rationally justified belief in miracles. Such a defense can legitimately dispense with much of the paraphernalia that professional scholars in a discipline use in writing for other professional scholars in their discipline-some scholarly texts seem to be more references than argument-but it must not &#34;dumb down&#34; the material by oversimplifying the issues, or presenting &#34;straw man&#34; versions of the arguments it seeks to refute. My hope is that not only those who are already convinced of the rationality of belief in miracles will read this book, but also those who are unconvinced.</p><p>Robert Larmer is Professor and Chair of the Philosophy Department at the University of New Brunswick. He has authored several previous books on the concept of miracle, the most recent being The Legitimacy of Miracle (2014).''For several decades, Robert Larmer has labored over the various topics related to miracles. And with Dialogues on Miracles , we are treated to the mature fruit of his labor. This book is simply excellent. It updates coverage of traditional topics (the definition of a miracle), but it adds topics seldom related to miracles (miracles and the problem of evil). And besides being treated to a feast of ideas regarding miracles, Larmer writes the book in a dialogue style, making the ideas very accessible. . . . I highly recommend <i>Dialogues on Miracles</i> .''<br>--JP Moreland, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Biola University<br><br>''Robert Larmer writes with consummate skill on the controversial and elusive concept of miracle. This engaging book, which makes effective use of dialogue, continues his previous studies of the topic, which now spans more than twenty-five years. It exhibits the insight that can be gained by viewing some matter from every conceivable angle. What is more, he thinks that (real) miracle occurs. Few philosophers even think that is possible, and even fewer would say so.''<br>--Phillip H. Wiebe, Professor of Philosophy, Trinity Western University<br><br>''Larmer's philosophical work manifests two rare qualities. First, crystal clarity: he expresses difficult concepts in a way that almost everyone can understand, avoiding needless, pedantic jargon. Second, genuine fairness: he presents alternative viewpoints in their best possible light, never setting up 'straw men' to knock down. Both of these admirable qualities are on full display in this present volume. . . . The result is a book that is likely to become the standard introduction to the subject of miracles for many years to come.''<br>--Robert Stackpole, Director of the John Paul II Institute of Divine Mercy --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>Eaten Alive (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 1)</h2><p>Thirteen-year-old Tash, her younger brother Zak, and their Uncle Hoole visit the planet D&#39;vouran, where they encounter the sluglike crime lord Smada the Hutt and reports of people vanishing into thin air</p><p>ar Wars universe....Zak and Tash Arranda, and their guardian, Uncle Hoole, have landed on the planet D&#39;vouran.

On the surface a biography of obscure Southern minstrel singer and blackface comedian Emmett Miller (1900-62), his passionate text at its core is another installment in Tosches's lifelong inquiry into the nature of American popular music. It's a place, in his view, "where dead voices gather" as artists chaotically and indiscriminately pluck tunes out of sources ranging from English ballads to slave spirituals and fashion lyrics from half-remembered commercial releases heard once on the radio or archetypal stories told so often that no one knows who first gave them voice. Miller was a "yodeling blues singer" who performed in blackface, adhering to the minstrelsy tradition that was in its death throes by the time he had his brief moment of fame in the 1920s. Tosches, who first heard a Miller recording in 1974, characterizes him as "one of the strangest and most stunning stylists ever to record ... the last mutant mongrel emanation of old and dead and dying styles, the first mutant mongrel emanation of a style far more reckless and free than the cool of scat." As this sentence suggests, Tosches's prose has calmed down hardly at all since his first book, <i>Country</i>, was published in 1977; you either love his freeform approach or it drives you nuts. Admirers will relish his marvelously dense and detailed portrait of pop music's crazy-quilt complexity, enriched by Tosches's encyclopedic knowledge of American culture. And he boldly stares the race question in the face, though not everyone will be convinced by his assertion that "it is the shared umbilicus of fantasy that sustains and unites ... the polar temperaments of minstrelsy and rap." This is another genre-smashing work from a writer as eccentric, provoking, and wholly original as the music he loves. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Nick Tosches&#39;s books include The Devil and Sonny Liston, Dino, Hellfire, and the novels Cut Numbers (Back Bay Books, Summer 2001) and Trinities. Thirty years of his writing was recently collected into The Nick Tosches Reader (Da Capo).

She had dismissed her publisher&#x2019;s pleas for such a novel. Written out of necessity to support her family, the book had an astounding success that changed her life, a life which turned out very differently from that of her beloved heroine Jo March. <p>In <i>Louisa May Alcott, </i>Susan Cheever, the acclaimed author of <i>American Bloomsbury, </i>returns to Concord, Massachusetts, to explore the life of one of its most iconic residents. Based on extensive research, journals, and correspondence, Cheever&#x2019;s biography chronicles all aspects of Alcott&#x2019;s life, from the fateful meeting of her parents to her death, just two days after that of her father. She details Bronson Alcott&#x2019;s stalwart educational vision, which led the Alcotts to relocate each time his progressive teaching went sour; her unsuccessful early attempts at serious literature, including <i>Moods</i>, which Henry James panned; her time as a Civil War nurse, when she contracted pneumonia and was treated with mercury-laden calomel, which would affect her health for the rest of her life; and her vibrant intellectual circle of writers and reformers, idealists who led the charge in support of antislavery, temperance, and women&#x2019;s rights. </p><p>Alcott&#x2019;s independence defied the conventional wisdom, and her personal choices and literary legacy continue to inspire generations of women. A fan of <i>Little Women </i>from the age of twelve, and a distinguished author in her own right, Cheever brings a unique perspective to Louisa May Alcott&#x2019;s life as a woman, a daughter, and a working writer.</p></p><p><b>Susan Cheever</b> is the bestselling author of thirteen previous books, including five novels and the memoirs <i>Note Found in a Bottle</i> and <i>Home Before Dark.</i> Her work has been nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award and won the <i>Boston Globe</i> Winship Medal. She is a Guggenheim Fellow, a member of the Corporation of Yaddo, and a member of the Author's Guild Council. She teaches in the Bennington College M.F.A. program. She lives in New York City with her family.Starred Review. Little Women was the idea of Alcott's publisher, who bullied her into writing it. Louisa may, Cheever speculates, have taken revenge on Bronson Alcott--a friend of the great Transcendentalists, but an irresponsible and browbeating father--by leaving him out of her semiautobiographical masterpiece. A revolutionary educator whose uncompromising high-mindedness made him a financial failure, Bronson was critical of and often punished the rebellious Louisa. But his close friendships with men like Emerson and Thoreau blessed Louisa with a unique circle of mentors, whom Cheever depicted in American Bloomsbury. Alcott gradually lost everyone dear to her: her beloved sister Lizzie died at 22, and her sister Anna's marriage felt like a betrayal. Struggling so hard for wealth and fame that when it came she was too ill and weary to enjoy it, Louisa never married and died two days after Bronson. Cheever laces this provocative biography with musings on the genesis of genius, and her identification with Jo March when she was a rebellious girl in the throes of puberty. While some may find Cheever's digressions and self-referencing grating, most will savor this work--surely a future book club staple--as keen, refreshing, and authoritative. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos.

It took the vision, courage, and perseverance of one manCharles Goodyearto reinvent rubber into the indispensable substance it is today. Noble Obsession is a riveting work of history that reads like enthralling fiction. It tells how Goodyear, a single-minded genius, risked his own life and his familys in a quest to unlock the secrets of rubber, and how Thomas Hancock, the scholarly English inventor who raced against Goodyear, ultimately robbed him of fame and fortune. Filled with villains, con men, and entrepreneurs, and brimming with fascinating facts about the science and business of rubber, Noble Obsession takes readers from the jungles of Brazil to the laboratories of Europe to the courtrooms of America to tell one of the strangest and most affecting sagas in the history of human discovery.</p><p><b>Charles Slack</b> is the author of <i>Blue Fairways</i>. A former newspaper reporter in Virginia and Tennessee, he is now a freelance writer whose work has appeared in <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</i>, and other national magazines. He lives in Trumball, Connecticut.Like crude oil, cotton and plutonium, rubber is on the short list of raw materials that suddenly yielded transformative commercial benefits. The turning point was the 1839 discovery of vulcanization, whereby the heated addition of sulfur permits rubber to retain its shape regardless of temperature. Without sulfur, rubber melts or cracks when exposed to heat or cold. Goodyear was the implacable, obsessed true believer who made possible "the great shock absorber of the industrial age." Slack (Blue Fairways) ably chronicles the inspirations and intrigues surrounding the miraculous substance, which in its day sparked speculation comparable to the Internet boom. Shrewd and meticulous, British rubber pioneer Hancock receives equal billing, but this is Goodyear's book. Slack is Goodyear's advocate throughout, judiciously slicing through the self-serving arguments of Goodyear's adversaries. Countless setbacks, massive debt and perpetual destitution were unable to dent Goodyear's faith in rubber by all accounts, his wife, Clarissa, was blessed with an otherworldly patience. With his "debilitating lack of business sense" and an "almost superhuman capacity to endure," only Goodyear was dogged enough to stumble upon vulcanization. Sadly, his discovery brought not wealth but lengthy legal battles to establish proper credit, which he eventually secured. Slack's portrait of Goodyear is frequently touching, but the book loses focus in its final chapters. This is generally a fascinating portrait of the transitional period in America's progress from farmland to factory and, eventually, to freeway.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dope, Inc: Britain&#39;s Opium War Against the World</h2><p>The Opium Wars of 1840-1860 were dark chapters in the history of colonialism, when Britain made war on the Chinese to force them to import thousands of tons of opium, which crippled and impoverished their nation. It&#39;s much less well-known that the Opium Wars never really ended. The United States, like China, was too great for the London money lords to occupy directly.

Vibrant color reproductions of the artist&#x2019;s interior portraits, street scenes, and landscapes, along with striking installation shots, present the self-taught classicism that Balthus cultivated as a framework for his more enigmatic artistic investigations. A conversation between Olivier Zahm and Setsuko Klossowska de Rola completes the catalogue, providing an insightful look into the world of this reclusive painter of charged and disquieting narrative scenes.</p><p><b>Olivier Zahm</b> is the cofounder and editor in chief of <i>Purple Fashion</i>.

Klossowski de Rola defends Balthus' insistence on privacy, then offers a few tantalizing biographical facts and a set of striking photographs of the artist. Readers are free, then, to study and interpret Balthus' intriguing, unsettling, brilliantly stylized, richly textured, and strongly composed street scenes, portraits, still lifes, and landscapes. His most famous paintings date from the 1930s and 1940s and feature, in his son's words, "languid adolescent" girls, images Klossowski de Rola insists are "untouchable archetypes of purity," but which are clearly erotic works of the highest order. Balthus, nearly 90 and still working, is a profoundly sensual painter, both in his handling of paint and in his subject matter. What's "pure" and magnificent here is the artist's sense of eroticism and immense talent. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>A Confederate General From Big Sur</h2><p>The year is 1957 in a California that was a preview of things to come in America -- the dawn of lifestyles that were eventually to have a profound and disturbing effect on our culture.

Devoted to critical interpretation and discussion of an authors work, each study takes account of major literary trends and important scholarly contributions and provides new critical insights with an original point of view. An Authors Series volume addresses readers ranging from advanced high school students to university professors. The book suggests to the informed reader new ways of considering a writers work. A reader new to the work under examination will, after reading the Authors Series, be compelled to turn to the originals, bringing to the reading a basic knowledge and fresh critical perspectives.</p></p><p>E.T.A. Hoffmann, a lawyer and bureaucrat by profession, is most readily recognized as the author of the fairy tale The Nutuacker, which was adapted by Tchaikovsky for his ballet. Hoffmann was also the author of more than three dozen stories, seven fairy tales, and two novels, as well as numerous critical essays on music. In E.T.A. Hoffman, James M. McGlathery provides a complete account of Hoffmann&#39;s literary works, including deft summaries of the short stories and thorough explications of the fairy tales and novels. McGlathery&#39;s biographical treatment of Hoffmann illuminates how the Napoleonic wars shaped the author&#39;s career and subsequent literary development. McGlathery traces other important influences on the developing writer: Hoffmann&#39;s acquaintance with several prominent physicians sparked his interest in the emerging field of psychiatric medicine and inspired the psychological elements of his writing. Hoffmann&#39;s music criticism is also given due attention and is examined against his fiction. His works reflect the Romantic era in Germany and are early examples of an interest in the subconscious in literature.</p><h2>The Leo Frank Case (A Brown Thrasher Book)</h2><p><p>The events surrounding the 1913 murder of the young Atlanta factory worker Mary Phagan and the subsequent lynching of Leo Frank, the transplanted northern Jew who was her employer and accused killer, were so wide ranging and tumultuous that they prompted both the founding of B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith&#x2019;s Anti-Defamation League and the revival of the Ku Klux Klan. <i>The Leo Frank Case</i> was the first comprehensive account of not only Phagan&#x2019;s murder and Frank&#x2019;s trial and lynching but also the sensational newspaper coverage, popular hysteria, and legal demagoguery that surrounded these events.</p><p>Forty years after the book first appeared, and more than ninety years after the deaths of Phagan and Frank, it remains a gripping account of injustice. In his preface to the revised edition, Leonard Dinnerstein discusses the ongoing cultural impact of the Frank affair.</p></p><p>Leonard Dinnerstein is an emeritus professor of American history at the University of Arizona, where he directed the Judaic Studies Program. His books include America and the Survivors of the Holocaust and Antisemitism in America.<p>Eighty-five years ago the murder of Mary Phagan and the subsequent trial and lynching of the accused killer, Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager from the North, was the event that prompted B'nai B'rith to found the Anti-Defamation League. Dinnerstein not only tells the story of Phagan's and Frank's deaths, but he also places Frank's trial and lynching in the context of a rapidly changing southern society.</p> (<i>Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies</i>)<br><br><p>The author's thorough research, his careful organization of the findings, his cautious and dispassionate appraisal presented in lean and readable prose, all combine to inspire confidence that historians now have as nearly as they shall ever have the complete account of this tragedy.</p> (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br><p>Dinnerstein's study offers a running commentary on these events in their relation to the general southern and local Georgian endemic xenophobia in 1913-1915; anti-Semitism and the response of organized Jewish self-defense; trial by sensational newspaper coverage; and 'case-building' by the police, inept legal defense, and judicial cowardice.</p> (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br><p>Much has been written about the famed Leo Frank case. . . . Of them all, Leonard Dinnerstein's The Leo Frank Case . . . has always been considered the standard work.</p> (H-South)<br><br><p>The author's research has been painstaking and thorough; material was located in many Northern as well as Georgian collections. The selection of Georgia newspapers was judicious and representative.</p> (<i>Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br><p>Dinnerstein's analysis should interest students of southern history, anti-Semitism, civil liberties and social change. His conclusion, that unless societies 'eradicate the conditions which turn men into beasts. . . other Leo Franks will continue to appear,' seems particularly appropriate in our own time of racial strife and international conflict.</p> (<i>American Quarterly</i>)</p><h2>Graphic Design: A New History</h2><p>This exciting new history of graphic design explores its evolution from the late 19th century to the present day. Organized chronologically, the book illuminates the dynamic relationship between design and manufacturing as well as the roles of technology, social change, and commercial forces on the course of design history. The layout of each chapter reflects the unique style of the period it describes, and some 450 illustrations throughout the volume provide a visual record of more than one hundred years of creative achievement in the field.<br>Under the influence of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement in the late 19th century, a new era began for design arts. Fueled by popular Art Nouveau advertising, the work of graphic designers became central in the growing consumer goods economy. This book traces the emergence of varied modernist design styles in the early 20th century and then examines the wartime politicization of regional styles through American government patronage and revolutionary Soviet ideas. Richly contextualized chapters chronicle the history of the Bauhaus and the rise of the International Style, followed by the postmodern movement of the 1970s and '80s. After highlighting recent developments in graphic design around the globe, the author discusses the impact of inexpensive, powerful design software and the challenges facing designers now.</p><p><strong>Stephen Eskilson</strong> is associate professor, Art Department, Eastern Illinois University.

The book highlights and defines key terms, visually spotlights central information within chapters, and displays high-quality, detailed images throughout. <i>Graphic Design: A New History </i>will draw students in with exciting imagery and expand their knowledge with an engrossing narrative that presents an evolution of events unfolding as with any captivating plot."&#x2014;Rebecca Klein Ganz, Savannah College of Art and Design<br> (Rebecca Klein Ganz)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Graphic Design: A New History</i> might well become a new standard in the field of critical graphic design history. A great strength of the book is the author&#x2019;s attention to the relation of graphic design to larger social issues, especially the formation of national identity. Another is his facility in visual analysis and ability to elucidate the meanings embedded in the formal aspects of design and typography. The book effectively integrates graphic design history into contemporaneous aesthetic debates, and relates the work to fine arts, decorative arts, and architecture. The illustrations are remarkably good, extensive, and well printed. The text has at least a brief discussion of every piece illustrated, which makes it an excellent resource and provides students with a model of how to deal with design analytically. I would recommend this book for college-level history of graphic design courses, and as a general background text for a graduate-level introduction to the field.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ethan Robey, Parsons The New School for Design/Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum<br> (Ethan Robey)<br><br>&#x201c;Stephen Eskilson&#x2019;s new book, <i>Graphic Design: A New History</i>, is a comprehensive, thorough, well-illustrated and up-to-date survey of graphic design history. Amassing almost 500 pages, along with hundreds of color images, Eskilson&#x2019;s new book should most certainly share shelf space with Philip Meggs&#x2019; <i>History of Graphic Design</i>, which until now has really been the only complete history of this relatively young but ever more prevalent design field. Eskilson&#x2019;s book presents visual examples and contextual descriptions of how print, advertising, and design evolved and responded to currents in mainstream social, cultural, and political affairs. Students should find the book accessible, readable, and full of necessary introductory information. This volume offers enormous amounts of useful facts and background, and without a doubt it would be an appropriate book for any student of graphic design.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lucinda Hitchcock, Rhode Island School of Design<br> (Lucinda Hitchcock)<br><br>"An excellent survey of graphic design from the late 19th- to the early 21st century, this book is well written, highly accessible, and demonstrates sound scholarly research. Although the main focus is on the 20th century (unlike Philip B. Meggs's <i>History of Graphic Design</i>), this work compliments the prior with a much expanded contextual and historical framework. The author establishes connections to social, political, cultural, and technical developments that influenced the aesthetic outcome of graphic design work over time. The book is superbly illustrated in full color, which makes for a much better appreciation, understanding, and absorption of the topics discussed, and includes many lesser known samples from within the design discourse. Lastly, the text truly leads up to the most recent 21st-century developments in design, issues with which design students and professionals are currently grappling. <i>Graphic Design: A New History</i> is excellent for use with coursework in graphic design as well as other cultural studies classes, both at colleges and art schools.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henk van Assen, Yale University School of Art<br> (Henk van Assen)<br><br>&#x201c;Stephen Eskilson has written an expansive new book on the history of modern graphic design. Rather than reconstruct the typical 'pyramids to Picasso' chronology, he begins with a richly detailed and insightful summary of the later part of the 19th century and assembles a remarkably thorough review of art and communications from the avant-garde and the war years to the international style, post modern design, and digital media. Interspersed with examples of architecture, references to contemporary essays and journals, and both familiar and new illustrations, it is perhaps the most inclusive, thorough, and up-to-date assessment of design available. It will prove accessible to students, authoritative to professionals and educators, and will provide an excellent basis for a comprehensive understanding of essential developments in contemporary visual culture. This is one of the most comprehensive and detailed texts I have encountered and is essential reading for any student or designer studying the history of 20th century design.&#x201d;&#x2014;Doug Wadden, University of Washington (Doug Wadden)<br><br>"What makes this history 'new' is the author's focus on the role that technology has played, for better or worse, in the evolution of design style."&#x2014;Lisa Rossi, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (Lisa Rossi <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2007-12-15)<br><br>"[Eskilson] has done excellent work. . . .

Joan Potter Loveless came to Taos in the early 1950s fresh out of Black Mountain College where she had studied weaving with Anni Albers. When she and her artist husband and baby daughter arrived in their Model A convertible they did not suspect that they would establish a relationship with the region that would pull them back again and again. Loveless's life became intertwined with that of her friends Rachel Brown and Kristina Wilson. They shared with her a love for the New Mexico landscape, their work as weavers and spinners, and the joys and sorrows of children and grandchildren.<br>In addition to the story of their friendship, this is the story of the evolution of their work--a relationship with wool that is unique to each weaver but for each intimately related to Northern New Mexico. As their careers developed they participated in craft co-ops, educational programs, and commercial ventures, including Tierra Wools in Los Ojos, New Mexico, and Weaving Southwest in Taos. Anyone who has ever made a living as a craftsperson or thought about doing so will delight in Joan Loveless's thoughtful evocation of this way of life.<br>Loveless beautifully captures the spirit of Taos valley, the texture of daily life, and the challenge of the creative process. Anyone with an interest in the culture of the Southwest or the history of the Taos art colony will enjoy Three Weavers.</p><p>A biographical account of the lives of three women weavers and their families in the Taos area of northern New Mexico, this book is also a chronology of their artistic development. Over a 40-year period, these transplanted New Englanders became active in the Taos weaving revival, particularly in the formation of local and rural weaving cooperatives. Loveless is at her best when describing the thinking and creative processes involved in the creation of a woven piece and the development of cooperative ventures. Fine descriptions of the New Mexico landscape and traditional adobe construction are interwoven with some poignant but mostly mundane accounts of family life. One might have wished for fewer accounts of family members' comings and goings and more of the impact of these family events on the creative output of the weavers.

Officially, it didn&#x2019;t exist. It was an inside joke, Area 51 being the airbase in the Nevada desert where the aliens from the Roswell UFO crash were allegedly taken. The people who worked there didn&#x2019;t even know where they were. They were flown in and out on jets with no windows. They worked on projects funded from the unaccountable Black Budget, and the money supply was almost endless. Ask for a new piece of scientific equipment, and it would show up within a week.</p><p>Eddie Parker didn&#x2019;t care where the place was, never even thought of it as Area 52. He simply thought of it as the Lab.</p><p>Eddie did not work well with others, never had, and he knew that he would never rise very high in the rat&amp;150;maze bureaucracy and backstabbing atmosphere of most research establishments. Luckily for him, interacting with his fellow humans was not high on his list of priorities. At least that&#x2019;s what he told himself, until he met Jenny.</p><p>The security people would have preferred keeping the scientists at the Lab all the time. But they had tried long&amp;150;term sequestration and found that it tended to drive the researchers a little crazy. Since many of them were borderline crazy already, it didn&#x2019;t take much of a nudge to push them over the edge into uselessness. A certain amount of R&amp;R was needed. Two weeks decompression every three months was deemed about right.</p><p>Eddie did not want R&amp;R very much, as it took him away from his toys. But rules were rules. They asked him where he wanted to go and, picking a name out of the air, he said New York City. He&#x2019;d never been there.</p><p>They put him up in a suite in a fine hotel and he spent most of the first week at his highly secure laptop, communing with the supercomputers back at the Lab. But eventually he did venture out. He took in a movie, ate a hot dog at Nathan&#x2019;s, but mostly he just walked.</p><p>She was good. He would think he had lost her, then spot her wearing a different hat, with her coat reversed. She was there as both bodyguard and watchdog, and it seemed silly to him. He wasn&#x2019;t going to talk about his work and he wasn&#x2019;t going to run away. So he approached her and told her he knew what she was doing. She admitted it, and they had coffee together. After that, she stayed by his side. Her name was Jenny.</p><p>She was no raving beauty, but she was pretty enough, and smart. He found it easy to talk to her.</p><p>Then one evening as she was putting him to bed for the night, she kissed him, and though he was never sure just how it happened, he found himself in bed with her. It was his first time, and she seemed to know it&amp;151;later, he realized it was probably in his dossier, which she would have memorized&amp;151;and she was gentle and supportive of his awkwardness. That night, as sleep eluded him, he knew he was in love.</p><p>The next day he had to return to the Lab. They parted at the airport with kisses and made plans for their next meeting in three months.</p><p>His work suffered for a while, but it was all he really knew, and soon he was back into the project he had left behind. But for the first time he began to entertain notions of a life after the Lab. Perhaps even of quitting the Lab entirely, going to work in the private sector. He tossed ideas around, ideas he planned to share with Jenny when he returned to New York and met her for breakfast at Windows on the World, at the top of the North Tower of the World Trade Center.</p><p><br>They never found enough of her to identify. He stood all day just outside the police lines, inhaling dust and grit, until his new handler gently led him back to the hotel, where he informed them he was ready to return to the Lab. For a few days he hoped for a phone call&amp;151;<i>missed my train, the taxi broke down, oh my God, Eddie, when I think of how close I came to being there</i> . . . but it never came.</p><p>He felt the same frustration all Americans felt in the aftermath of the atrocity. <i>How do we get our revenge on nineteen dead men?</i>Killing Osama bin Laden would not be enough. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq gave him no satisfaction. Gradually he came to focus on the nineteen. Two things about them immediately stood out. All of them were Muslim. And fifteen of them came from Saudi Arabia.</p><p><i>Why are we bombing Iraq? Why aren&#x2019;t we bombing Saudi Arabia?</i></p><p>He was not the only one who harbored such thoughts about America&#x2019;s erstwhile ally in the newly declared &#x201c;War on Terror,&#x201d; but Eddie happened to be the only person who was equipped, personally, to do something about it.</p><p><br>Someone once said &#x201c;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#x201d; Eddie was in no hurry. His field was bacteria, those tiny bits of living material that descended from the very first life to appear on Earth, around 4 billion years ago. It was quite likely that he knew more about bacteria than anyone else alive. It was certain that he knew more about methods of manipulating, cloning, and even creating them than anyone, because no one else in the world had the facilities available to him.</p><p>Bacteria are the ultimate survivors, mutating quickly in response to antibiotics, able to thrive at high levels of radioactivity, acidity, and at temperatures up to 270 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Eddie had worked on the development of bacteria targeted on oil spills. But in recent years he had been concentrating on ways to use bacteria to recover more oil from proven reserves. The problem was that though there was still oil underground, the easy oil had been pumped already. The days when you could poke a hole in the ground and stand back as the black gold gushed out were long gone. The oil reserves remaining on the planet were increasingly hard to get at. Most of the oil in fields currently producing, including those in Saudi Arabia, could only be recovered by increasingly exotic means.</p><p>Eddie had been working on a bacterium that would enable the crude in existing wells to flow more easily, or to naturally increase the underground pressure. It was called the Prometheus Project.</p><p>He focused on the largest oil field in the world, the Ghawar, a strip 175 miles long by 20 miles wide, 100 miles due east of Riyadh, in the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The most common technology for getting the remaining oil out of a field was to inject water into the ground. But when you pump water in, you get some water back, and the percentage of oil to water is called the &#x201c;water cut.&#x201d; Fresh wells produce almost one hundred percent oil. With older fields, you got back more and more water until it was not worth the cost of injecting it. For some years now, the water cut at the Ghawar fields was on the order of 60 percent, and it would only continue to rise.</p><p>The Saudis wanted someone to do something about it. They wanted a magic bug that would turn the more sluggish fractions down in those wells into something that would flow like springwater, if not quite so sparkling.</p><p>Eddie told them he was their man. Everyone was hoping for results in a matter of months, but it took years. It was a real challenge, because he had to produce something that showed promise as a crude&amp;150;oil liquefier while at the same time hiding his work on the real bacterium he had in mind.</p><p>This bug would freeze Ghawar solid as a coal seam.</p><p>Try pumping <i>that</i>, you murderous bastards.</p><p>He finally perfected an organism he officially called the Prometheus Strain. It performed to perfection, stripping away enough hydrogen from the crude&amp;150;oil fractions to produce pressure, and leaving the residue liquid enough to pump.</p><p>But he didn&#x2019;t tell anyone about the culture for a while. He had more work to do. He produced a second culture, Prometheus Two, a variant of the first. It was amazing what a difference a few little genes here and there could make.</p><p>When the second culture was ready, he announced that he had found the solution to the depleted&amp;150;oilfield problem.</p><p>He demonstrated Prometheus in the lab, and it performed perfectly. Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi prince sent to witness the demonstration, was impressed. He wanted to try it in the field.</p><p>Eddie boarded the windowless plane with Prince bin Sultan and they flew to Washington, where they boarded the prince&#x2019;s private A&amp;150;380, a two&amp;150;story airborne palace with a staff of twenty and only himself and the prince as passengers. Eddie ate a fine meal, and then slept soundly in a large bedroom.</p><p>He woke when the plane was descending into Dubai. He saw the gleaming spire of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest man&amp;150;made structure in the world, and almost empty. He could make out the outlines of the gigantic Palm Jumeirah and the even larger Palm Jebel Ali housing developments, gigantic artificial islands, huge landfills in the shape of palm trees dotted with resort hotels and mansions.</p><p>All built not on sand, but on oil. Take away the oil, and those people down below would still be fishing from dhows and traveling on camels. They wouldn&#x2019;t have much time to raise fanatic young terrorists willing to fly airplanes into buildings. They wouldn&#x2019;t even have the airfare to get aboard.</p><p>The next day, Eddie was taken to the Ghawar field and, with little ceremony, added Jenny Two to the slurry being pumped into the ground.</p><p>Two weeks later, the Ghawar field exploded.</p><p><br>Dave thought it was his own snoring that woke him up. He was leaning back in his ergonomic chair, and when he slept in that position he could wake the dead.</p><p>The sun was turning the sky pink in the east. Most of the lights were still on in the towers of Century City, below him. A marine layer of low clouds had moved in over Santa Monica, as it usually did that time of year. Much of yesterday&#x2019;s smog had dispersed to wherever yesterday&#x2019;s smog goes, and today&#x2019;s batch wasn&#x2019;t brewing yet. The streets he could see were almost deserted.</p><p>He was stiff and sore all over. Not as easy to pull an all&amp;150;nighter when you&#x2019;re almost forty as it was in college. He started a pot of coffee and sat back down to read what he had written.</p><p>Six pages, seventeen hundred words. It sounded good to him.</p><p>It was partly extrapolation. The truth was, at that point he was far from sure &#x201c;Eddie Parker&#x201d; even existed. The colonel had not given him a name, Dave made that up. He was just &#x201c;one of the big brains at a very secret lab.&#x201d; But that didn&#x2019;t matter, as the whole story was highly unlikely, but good enough for a movie.</p><p>His cell phone rang. It was the colonel.</p><p>&#x201c;Get your ass over here, right now,&#x201d; he growled.</p><p><br>The colonel let him in, and then looked up and down the hallway before shutting the door behind him. He threw the lock and set the chain, then gestured Dave toward a glass&amp;150;topped table near the front window, looking out over Hollywood Boulevard to the Pantages Theater. On the table was a laptop, a partially disassembled semiautomatic handgun, and a cleaning kit. He gestured him toward a chair at the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Something to drink?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A little early for me,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too. I got coffee, tea . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>It was the first time he&#x2019;d been in Warner&#x2019;s apartment. It was minimalist, almost Spartan, with very little to give it that lived&amp;150;in feeling. There was no artwork on the walls, no military mementos, no personal touches at all. A few beige leather couches and chairs in the living room, a gas fireplace, a wall&amp;150;sized flat&amp;150;screen television. No DVDs, only a few books in a small bookcase. It was the room of a man who had lived in barracks all his life and kept all his possessions in a duffel bag, ready to move in five minutes.</p><p>There was a pair of large gun safes. The doors of one of them were standing open, and he saw rifles, shotguns, and handguns, all looking well cared for. He didn&#x2019;t know a lot about guns, but he knew some of them were military weapons that he wasn&#x2019;t sure were actually legal. But that was none of his business.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m ashamed to admit that I don&#x2019;t remember a lot about yesterday, beyond a certain point,&#x201d; the colonel said. &#x201c;I do have the distinct impression that I ended up saying a lot more than I should have.&#x201d; He grimaced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve spent my whole life keeping my lip zipped. I&#x2019;m pretty good at it. But you&#x2019;ve had me talking on this project of yours . . . about things that I&#x2019;m authorized to talk about, mind you.&#x201d; He stopped, and shrugged. &#x201c;I guess I got in the habit of talking to you. Things got out of hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got the impression that you were pretty shaken up,&#x201d; Dave said.</p><p>&#x201c;You can say that again. Before yesterday, I was just getting rumors. You&#x2019;ve noticed the stock market lately?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It would be hard not to. Up, down, up again. Mostly down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Driven by oil prices, and futures,&#x201d; Warner said. &#x201c;Oil&#x2019;s over two&amp;150;fifty a barrel, and still rising with no end in sight. The big investors are getting worried. Especially now that they&#x2019;re getting wind of some of the rumors I&#x2019;ve been hearing for the last couple of weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Frankly, Colonel, that&#x2019;s what makes that story you told me yesterday kind of hard to swallow. How could all this be happening and nobody knows anything about it?&#x201d;</p><p>Colonel Warner picked up part of the disassembled pistol lying on the table. He began running a cleaning rag through the barrel. He sighed, and looked at Dave.</p><p>&#x201c;Obviously people know about it. But as soon as the shit started to come down in Saudi, they clamped a national security lid on it as tight as any I&#x2019;ve ever seen. In the first week the secretary of state paid a visit to Riyadh, and so did the leaders of the oil&amp;150;producing countries in the region. I don&#x2019;t have any idea what they decided to do about it. But the top people at Saudi Aramco were sworn to secrecy, and told they could be arrested and have a major extraordinary rendition put on their ass, flown off to some shit&amp;150;hole country where they could be shot without a trial. Saudi Aramco, if you didn&#x2019;t know, is the state&amp;150;owned oil company. It&#x2019;s the most profitable company in the world. They own Ghawar, the biggest oil field in the world, and Safaniyah, the biggest offshore field, in the northern Persian Gulf. Plus dozens of smaller fields. They produce 15 million barrels of crude every day.</p><p>&#x201c;Or, let&#x2019;s say they used to.&#x201d;</p><p>He moved his chair to sit behind his computer installation and gestured Dave over to sit beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s Google Earth looking down at the Ghawar field,&#x201d; the colonel said. Dave leaned forward, trying to figure it out. Warner moved the cursor around quickly.</p><p>&#x201c;Lots of sand. Not much to see unless you know what you&#x2019;re looking for. You can pick out roads here, and here. The big black squares are towns for oil workers. These black dots are wellheads. Thousands of them. Here&#x2019;s a pipeline.</p><p>&#x201c;But look at the date. Google is great, but it&#x2019;s not current. Now, let me show you what that same area looked like yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>He moved to another keyboard, another twenty&amp;150;four&amp;150;inch flat screen. He typed quickly. A password window popped up.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to ask you to look away for a minute,&#x201d; Warner said. &#x201c;This is classified satellite data from the Nationa...</p></p><h2>Philosophy Looks At The Arts</h2><p>Offers an introduction to analytic aesthetics.

She lives in Oxford, UK.Rooftoppers <br><br> 1 <p></p> <br>ON THE MORNING of its First Birthday, a baby was found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel.<br> <br>It was the only living thing for miles. Just the baby, and some dining room chairs, and the tip of a ship disappearing into the ocean. There had been music in the dining hall, and it was music so loud and so good that nobody had noticed the water flooding in over the carpet. The violins went on sawing for some time after the screaming had begun. Sometimes the shriek of a passenger would duet with a high C.<br> <br>The baby was found wrapped for warmth in the musical score of a Beethoven symphony. It had drifted almost a mile from the ship, and was the last to be rescued. The man who lifted it into the rescue boat was a fellow passenger, and a scholar. It is a scholar&#x2019;s job to notice things. He noticed that it was a girl, with hair the color of lightning, and the smile of a shy person.<br> <br>Think of nighttime with a speaking voice. Or think how moonlight might talk, or think of ink, if ink had vocal cords. Give those things a narrow aristocratic face with hooked eyebrows, and long arms and legs, and that is what the baby saw as she was lifted out of her cello case and up into safety. His name was Charles Maxim, and he determined, as he held her in his large hands&#x2014;at arm&#x2019;s length, as he would a leaky flowerpot&#x2014;that he would keep her.<br> <br>The baby was almost certainly one year old. They knew this because of the red rosette pinned to her front, which read, 1!<br> <br>&#x201c;Or rather,&#x201d; said Charles Maxim, &#x201c;the child is either one year old or she has come first in a competition. I believe babies are rarely keen participants in competitive sport. Shall we therefore assume it is the former?&#x201d; The girl held on to his earlobe with a grubby finger and thumb. &#x201c;Happy birthday, my child,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Charles did not only give the baby a birthday. He also gave her a name. He chose Sophie, on that first day, on the grounds that nobody could possibly object to it. &#x201c;Your day has been dramatic and extraordinary enough, child,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It might be best to have the most ordinary name available. You can be Mary, or Betty, or Sophie. Or, at a stretch, Mildred. Your choice.&#x201d; Sophie had smiled when he&#x2019;d said &#x201c;Sophie,&#x201d; so Sophie it was. Then he fetched his coat, and folded her up in it, and took her home in a carriage. It rained a little, but it did not worry either of them. Charles did not generally notice the weather, and Sophie had already survived a lot of water that day.<br> <br>Charles had never really known a child before. He told Sophie as much on the way home: &#x201c;I do, I&#x2019;m afraid, understand books far more readily than I understand people. Books are so easy to get along with.&#x201d; The carriage ride took four hours; Charles held Sophie on the very edge of his knee and told her about himself, as though she were an acquaintance at a tea party. He was thirty-six years old, and six foot three. He spoke English to people and French to cats, and Latin to the birds. He had once nearly killed himself trying to read and ride a horse at the same time. &#x201c;But I will be more careful,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;now that there is you, little cello child.&#x201d; Charles&#x2019;s home was beautiful, but it was not safe; it was all staircases and slippery floorboards and sharp corners. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy some smaller chairs,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll have thick red carpets! Although&#x2014;how does one go about acquiring carpets? I don&#x2019;t suppose you know, Sophie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Unsurprisingly, Sophie did not answer. She was too young to talk, and she was asleep.<br> <br>She woke when they drew up in a street smelling of trees and horse dung. Sophie loved the house at first sight. The bricks were painted the brightest white in London, and shone even in the dark. The basement was used to store the overflow of books and paintings and several brands of spiders, and the roof belonged to the birds. Charles lived in the space in between.<br> <br>At home, after a hot bath in front of the stove, Sophie looked very white and fragile. Charles had not known that a baby was so terrifyingly tiny a thing. She felt too small in his arms. He was almost relieved when there was a knock at the door; he laid Sophie down carefully on a chair, with a Shakespearean play as a booster seat, and went down the stairs two at a time.<br> <br>When he returned, he was accompanied by a large gray-haired woman; Hamlet was slightly damp, and Sophie was looking embarrassed. Charles scooped her up and set her down&#x2014;hesitating first over an umbrella stand in a corner, and then over the top of the stove&#x2014;inside the sink. He smiled, and his eyebrows and eyes smiled too. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We all have accidents, Sophie.&#x201d; Then he bowed at the woman. &#x201c;Let me introduce you. Sophie, this is Miss Eliot, from the National Childcare Agency. Miss Eliot, this is Sophie, from the ocean.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman sighed&#x2014;an official sort of sigh, it would have sounded, from Sophie&#x2019;s place in the sink&#x2014;and frowned, and pulled clean clothes from a parcel. &#x201c;Give her to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles took the clothes from her. &#x201c;I took this child from the sea, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Sophie watched, with large eyes. &#x201c;She has nobody to keep her safe. Whether I like it or not, she is my responsibility.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The child is your ward. She is not your daughter.&#x201d; This was the sort of woman who spoke in italics. You would be willing to lay bets that her hobby was organizing people. &#x201c;This is a temporary arrangement.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg to differ,&#x201d; said Charles. &#x201c;But we can fight about that later. The child is cold.&#x201d; He handed the undershirt to Sophie, who sucked on it. He took it back and put it on her. Then he hefted her in his arms, as though about to guess her weight at a fair, and looked at her closely. &#x201c;You see? She seems a very intelligent baby.&#x201d; Sophie&#x2019;s fingers, he saw, were long and thin, and clever. &#x201c;And she has hair the color of lightning. How could you possibly resist her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to come round, to check on her, and I really don&#x2019;t have the time to spare. A man can&#x2019;t do this kind of thing alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly, please do come,&#x201d; said Charles&#x2014;and he added, as if he couldn&#x2019;t stop himself, &#x201c;if you feel that you absolutely can&#x2019;t stay away. I will endeavor to be grateful. But this child is my responsibility. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a child! You&#x2019;re a man!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your powers of observation are formidable,&#x201d; said Charles. &#x201c;You are a credit to your optician.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But what are you going to do with her?&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles looked bewildered. &#x201c;I am going to love her. That should be enough, if the poetry I&#x2019;ve read is anything to go by.&#x201d; Charles handed Sophie a red apple, then took it back and rubbed it on his sleeve until he could see his face in it. He said, &#x201c;I am sure the secrets of child care, dark and mysterious though they no doubt are, are not impenetrable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles set the baby on his knee, handed her the apple, and began to read out loud to her from A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream.<br> <br>It was not, perhaps, the perfect way to begin a new life, but it showed potential.</p><h2>Christianity in Cleats</h2><p>CHRISTIANITY IN CLEATS is an excellent description of Al Worthington, or at least the latter part of his fantastic pitching career. Al was a standout at the University of Alabama- from there he quickly moved up into the Major League. Saved at a Billy Graham Crusade, he became a fantastic witness for Christ- on the field, on the streets, in churches, and at his famous Baseball Camps. This is a &#x201c;Must-read&#x201d; book for fans of baseball and Christianity- as he shares impressive and inspiring stories of his life.</p><p></p><h2>FISH SOUP</h2><p>Best friends, the Thinking Man of Moha and the Writing Woman of Maho believe that it would be convenient to have a child who could run messages between them, but the magical children that they conujure up are not quite what they had expected</p><p>Grade 1-3-- The Thinking Man and the Writing Woman cement their friendship by dreaming up their ideal children. He imagines a little girl who flutters and twinkles; she imagines a little boy who can fish and produce food for them. And lo! the children appear, but there is something wrong with them. The boy grows much too large to shelter, and the girl is nothing but a dress and shoes. Soon the adults realize they have expected the wrong things of the youngsters: too much of the boy and not enough of the girl. All is then put to rights. The setting of this social allegory is a far-off land of romance, in a literary sense. It is a story of mysterious events and idealized love. Writing Woman's books, which include The Oxford Elvish Dictionary and Logic Made Difficult , are strongly suggestive of the mythic nature of the tale. Flying mice and talking cats add to the otherworldliness, but there are blunt points made, too; the woman keeps a messy house, while the man is a neatnik. The effort to avoid a stereotype is almost itself a stereotype. Black-and-white drawings on a pale yellow background portray realistic humans set in a folkloric environment. Snug little cottages with twining vines and bottle glass windows appear in forests filled with gnarled trees and gnomish mushrooms. A good choice for those looking for easy fiction on gender discrimination. --Ruth Semrau, Lovejoy School, Allen, TX<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.This meager original fable by celebrated author LeGuin concerns two adult friends, Thinking Man and Writing Woman. He is impeccably neat; she could care less about being tidy. He thinks; she writes and makes books. While they maintain separate lives (and homes), they enjoy each other's company. On one occasion, they speculate what kind of child they would each like. Thinking Man envisions a girl, but only as a flutter of dress and a patter of feet--nothing more. Writing Woman sees a boy--someone who can catch fish to be put into soup and perform other helpful chores. Their imaginations bring forth their own personal creations, with unexpected complications. Part fantasy, part comic look at parents' unrealistic expectations, this book may hold some vague appeal for children who like fantasy; LeGuin's loyal fans may also have an interest. All in all, however, the didactic tale isn't enough of a story from this gifted writer. Plus, Wynne's sepia-toned, cross-hatched art, despite a few clever touches (flying mice, a droll chess set), is bland--its prosaic, earthbound quality makes for a poor match with LeGuin's flight of fancy.

Together they have developed a mini-refuge at their home along the Rio Grande, where they now host thousands of migrating hummingbirds each summer.If you want to plant a garden that attracts hummingbirds and identify them when they arrive, Marcy Scott s Hummingbird Plants of the Southwest is surely the definitive book on the subject. Illustrated with superb macro photography of hummingbird and plant species, the book s expertly researched plant profiles draw on the author s deep experience. The plant selections include familiar favorites such as Salvia and Penstemon, but also plants far beyond the usual suspects. I m excited to try some of these, such as Townsend s sage and woolly blue curls, in my own garden this coming year. <b>--Scott Calhoun, author of <i>Yard Full of Sun</i></b> <br><br> Few books have been written to help those wanting to attract hummers to their Southwest gardens. This book is a welcome addition and is the most in-depth look at plant opportunities yet published.... Whether you are a gardener or hummingbird lover (or maybe both!), this book should be in your library. <b>--H. Ross Hawkins, <i>The Hummingbird Connection</i></b> <br><br> Exceptional, practical, informed informative, and thoroughly user friendly, [this book] is profusely and beautifully illustrated in full color. An ideal introduction and guide, <i>Hummingbird Plants Of The Southwest</i> is very highly recommended for personal, professional, community, and academic library...collections. <b>--Margaret Lane, <i>Midwest Book Review</i></b> <br><br> Scott uses skill, humor, and information to help us recognize the loss of habitat that can be attributed to our kind, and gently urges us to do our own little part to reverse some of the bad. <b>--Renee West, <i>Newsletter of the Native Plant Society of New Mexico</i></b> <br><br> I learned several tidbits from this book which I had not known. [This] is a great reference book as well as a guide to setting up your hummingbird habitat. Recommended if you wish to attract hummingbirds. <b>--<i>Southern Arizona Guide</i></b> <br><br> You get a bouquet of books rolled into one when you pick this one up...Indeed, the whole thing, from photos, to species profiles, to the glossary, to the appendix on ways to help hummingbirds...is a natural history masterpiece. <b>--</b> --<b>Mark Pendleton, <i>Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost</i></b><br><br>Bird lovers in the hummingbird-rich Southwest finally have their own comprehensive guide to creating nectar gardens for these living jewels. <b> --Sheri L. Williamson, author of <i>A Field Guide to Hummingbirds of North America</i></b> <br><br> For Southwest habitat gardeners, especially gardens focused on pollinators, this book is an excellent resource for attracting hummingbirds. The author discusses how hummingbirds are great pollinators since they feed all day, reliably visit flowers year-round, and travel great distances which enhances the genetic variability in the seeds of the plants they visit.... For readers who may have no land or ambition to create a habitat garden, this book is still a pleasure to read. The photographs are superb; the author's writing style is colorful; and the layout of the book is very pleasing. The book encourages the reader to become an armchair field biologist, vicariously observing the foraging hummingbirds defend their territories, construct their nests, and pass between their winter and summer homes. --<b>--Karen LeMay, Founder of Pollinator Corridors SW; Arizona Native Plant Society</b><br><br>It is a beautiful book and should make a welcome addition to the library of all who admire hummingbirds. I am a life long birder and greatly enjoyed the sections on the birds. I find that like plants there is always more to learn about them. --Mary Irish, author of A Place All Our Own: Lives Entwined in a Desert Garden</p><h2>Cost Management: A Strategic Emphasis</h2><p>ISBN: 9781260091724 is an International Student Edition of Cost Management: A Strategic Emphasis 8th Edition by&nbsp;Edward Blocher, David F.

Cost Management: A Strategic Emphasis, by Blocher/Stout/Juras/Smith is dedicated to answering the question: Why Cost Management? It answers this question by providing cost-management tools and techniques needed to support an organization's competitiveness, improve its performance, and help the organization accomplish its strategy. The text is written to help students understand the broader role of cost accounting in helping an organization succeed - not just the measurement of costs. While the text does include coverage of traditional costing topics (e.g., job-order costing, process costing, service-department cost allocations, and accounting for joint and by-products), its primary strength is the linkage of these topics, as well as more contemporary topics, to an organization's strategy. And with Connect, an easy-to-use homework and learning management solution that embeds learning science and award-winning adaptive tools to improve student outcomes, instructors receive a course solution that includes high quality content and assessment paired with assignments that help students build the skills they need to succeed.</p><p></p><h2>Crisis in the Classroom</h2><p>This book showcases two approaches: 1) a deliberately bold examination of the American educational system, 2) a (then) trailblazing and innovative comparison of American education with other systems internationally. These approaches provide an innovative comprehensive critique of American education (with noteworthy focus on the purpose of domestic education, The book examines the individuals:1) The roles people play (i.e., parents, students, teachers, administration, school boards/conmittees, local communities and state/federal education boards &amp; organizations), The book also follows 2) the purpose of teaching in and of itself vis a vis teaching strategies, practices, roles, discipline in the classroom, and the purpose of the teaching act. Also, the book covers 3) the representation of American education in fictional and non-fictional portrayals in television and film and journalistic representation in TV and print news, federal organizations). The goal is to provide to persuade readers to reflect and reevaluate America's education system, provided the reader considers the author's conclusions that America prescribed to an ineffective one. The outcome is identifying issues, problems and flaws in American education through the roles of people, the purpose of teaching, and the effectiveness of education reform.</p><p></p><h2>A Decade of Revolution, 1789-1799</h2><p>Recounts the significant events of the French Revolution in an analysis of their impact on the evolution of ideas and institutions in the rise of modern Europe</p><p><p>inton /f Clarence /i Crane</p></p><h2>CENSORED SCIENCE:SUPPRESSED EV</h2><p>Full-color photography backs each page of this creationist guidebook.

Finally, an invitation for salvation is given. 111 pages, softcover.</p><p></p><h2>More Good Old Stuff</h2><p>A collection of fourteen stories, representing the best of MacDonald&#39;s early fiction from the 1940s and 1950s, includes such outstanding tales of mystery and suspense as &#34;Deadly Damsel,&#34; &#34;Death for Sale,&#34; &#34;Unmarried Widow,&#34; and &#34;Neighborly Interest&#34;</p><p>John D. MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>Scooby-Doo Reader #18: The Camping Caper (Level 2)</h2><p>Scooby-Doo, that lovable canine super-sleuth,is a Scholastic star.

London stepped up to the plate and with only two years to prepare the British Olympic organisers pulled off a successful Olympic Games. Miraculously, they managed to do so while shunning all municipal and government assistance and using only private enterprise for the arrangements. </p><p>In under a year, the White City stadium was built on the site of the forthcoming Franco-British exhibition, with a running track, cycling track, football field, swimming pool and platform for gymnastics and wrestling. Events at the 1908 Olympic Games included real tennis, tug-of-war, motor-boat racing, archery, rackets, and rugby; Olympic lacrosse also made its last appearance at these games. </p><p>In 1948 the Olympics came to Britain again, and to a country still recovering from the Second World War. During this Austerity Era, food, clothing and&nbsp;gasoline were heavily rationed, and the Olympic organizers had to make do with what little they had at their disposal. </p><p>The indomitable spirit of Londoners cheerfully overcame every obstacle, including shortages of equipment and appalling weather. British women athletes sewed their own uniforms; American competitors shared their beef steaks with the British; and the French brought a goods train full of wine and steak. Czechoslovakian Emil Z�topek, Fanny Blankers-Koen from The Netherlands and British Boy Scouts traveled together on the London Underground. Medals were awarded for art and poetry. The entire budget for the 1948 Games was �760,000, and they turned a profit of �29,000. </p><p>The first two London Olympics offer food for thought in the run-up to London 2012, with its multi-billion pound budget during a global economic recession, new sporting arenas, Olympic villages, and high-speed rail links. This history of London Olympics, which concludes with a look ahead to 2012, is a timely and fascinating chronicle of the Olympic Games of another age.</p></p><p>Janie Hampton is the author of more than fifteen books, including a biography of Joyce Grenfell and a history of the Girl Guide movement. In 2008 her book The Austerity Olympics was shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year prize, and the British Sports Book Awards best biography prize.

But it's the dramatic events that played out on the track and field that really capture the imagination. . . .

The works range from painstakingly crafted porcelains inspired by Chinese prototypes to rough-hewn vessels that revel in the happy accidents of wood-fired kilns to ironic &#x201c;objects&#x201d; that mimic newspapers, discarded trash and body parts. The selection is mostly drawn from the extensive collection of Halsey and Alice North of New York and reflects their informed taste; their bias is toward works made under the influence of the avant-garde S�deisha group, which challenged the traditional supremacy of utilitarian forms while maintaining its respect for technical excellence. Also widely covered are artists reacting in very different ways to the opportunities and challenges of their craft heritage, some breaking away toward pure sculpture, others reinventing the vessel ideal with an intriguing range of new forms and glaze effects. The book's commentaries on the artists discuss their backgrounds, the processes they employ and their places within the complex world of postwar Japanese ceramic history. In work that is playful, evocative, and avant-garde, the selected artists push the boundaries of our conception of ceramics.</p><p></p><h2>Out of the Dark (An Orphan X Novel)</h2><p>Evan Smoak, the Nowhere Man, is pitted against one of his own for the future of the country when a murderous President Bennett activates the Orphan program&#39;s first recruit.</p><p>GREGG HURWITZ is the New York Times bestselling author of thrillers, including Hellbent.

But helping Carrie Edwards with her Big Day has been an unrelenting nightmare. Carrie is a bridezilla of mythic nastiness, a diva whose tantrums are just about as crazy as her demands. But the unpleasant task at hand turns seriously criminal when Carrie is brutally murdered and everyone involved with the ceremony is accusing one another of doing the deed.<br><br>The problem is, most everyone&#x2014;from the cake maker and the florist to the wedding-gown retailer and the bridesmaids&#x2019; dressmaker&#x2014;had his or her own reason for wanting the bride dead, including Jaclyn. And while those who felt Carrie&#x2019;s wrath are now smiling at her demise, Jaclyn refuses to celebrate tragedy, especially since she finds herself in the shadow of suspicion.<br><br>Assigned to the case, Detective Eric Wilder finds that there&#x2019;s too much evidence pointing toward too many suspects. Compounding his problems is Jaclyn, with whom he shared one deeply passionate night before Carrie&#x2019;s death. Being a prime suspect means that Jaclyn is hands-off just when Eric would rather be hands-on. As the heat intensifies between Eric and Jaclyn, a cold-blooded murderer moves dangerously close. And this time the target is not a bride but one particularly irresistible wedding planner, unaware of a killer&#x2019;s vow.</p><p>Linda Howard is the award-winning author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <b>Ice, Burn</b>, and <b>Death Angel</b>. She lives in Alabama with her husband and a golden retriever.Chapter One<br><br>Six weddings in five days. <i>Holy shit.</i><br><br>All Jaclyn Wilde could think was that her mother, Madelyn, who was her partner in Premier, <i>the</i> events planning firm to hire in the greater Atlanta area if you wanted your guests to be impressed, must have been sipping a couple or twelve champagne martinis when she&#x2019;d accepted so many bookings so close together. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been nearly as bad if the bookings had been anything other than weddings: a party was simple in comparison to a wedding, because they were relatively free of emotional turmoil. A wedding, on the other hand, was fraught with every emotion known to man. It wasn&#x2019;t just the brides; it was the bride&#x2019;s mother, the groom&#x2019;s mother, the maid of honor, the bridesmaids, the parents of the flower girl and the ring bearer, the cousins who weren&#x2019;t invited to be in the wedding party, what colors to choose, the date, the location, the damn <i>font</i> on the friggin&#x2019; invitations . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Jaclyn Wilde,&#x201d; the clerk called, interrupting Jaclyn&#x2019;s increasingly stressed and frantic thoughts.<br><br>The clerk&#x2019;s voice was too cheerful. Didn&#x2019;t she realize it was inappropriate to sound cheerful when you were collecting payments for traffic violations? Maybe it was asking too much that she sound glum, but she could at least sound bored and noncom?mittal, instead of all but dancing with glee at taking someone&#x2019;s money.<br><br>Jaclyn stifled her irritation; it stemmed more from the almost impossible workload facing her during the coming week than it did from paying her speeding ticket. Adding to her stress was the fact that <i>because</i> they&#x2019;d been working so hard, she&#x2019;d forgotten to mail in the money for the speeding ticket, and today was the day it was due, so she&#x2019;d either had to take time off from work&#x2014;thereby increasing the stress by getting behind&#x2014;or have a warrant issued for her arrest. Yeah, that would be a real stress-reducer.<br><br>Being late was her fault. If the city of Hopewell, where she lived and where she&#x2019;d received the ticket, had been set up to receive online payments, she could have handled it that way, but it wasn&#x2019;t. She got up, silently forked over the cash, and a minute later was striding down the hall, the speeding ticket already forgotten because that particular item had just been checked off her to-do list.<br><br>She glanced down at her watch. She had just enough time to get to her next appointment&#x2014;Carrie Edwards, a bitch for all seasons, and one of the reasons why six weddings in five days was looming as Mission Impossible. Carrie&#x2019;s wedding wasn&#x2019;t even one of the six; her wedding wasn&#x2019;t for another month, but Carrie was taking up way too much of their time with her histrionics and constant flip-flopping on decisions. One bridesmaid had already told her&#x2014;Carrie, not Jaclyn&#x2014;to go fuck herself, which was a first in ?Jac?lyn&#x2019;s experience. Usually, no matter what the bride did, the members of the wedding party would grit their teeth and see it through. Even when they did drop out, they&#x2019;d make polite excuses. Not this girl; she&#x2019;d let Carrie have it with both barrels, and hadn&#x2019;t minced words.<br><br>When the blow-up happened, Jaclyn had stepped out of sight, allowed herself a wide smile and a fist pump, then schooled her expression and returned to try to forestall a hair-pulling, eye-gouging cat fight. She&#x2019;d have loved to see Carrie with a black eye, but business was business.<br><br>If she hadn&#x2019;t been so wrapped up in her thoughts she might have been faster on her feet, but when a door suddenly swung outward she was caught by surprise and slammed into the tall, dark-haired, dark-suited man who stepped into the corridor. She gave a short, sharp &#x201c;Oomph!&#x201d; The impact knocked her briefcase from her hand and sent it spinning across the gray-tiled floor. She felt one foot, elegantly shod in three-inch heels, begin to slip, and in panic instinctively grabbed the man&#x2019;s arm to steady herself. Her free arm slipped inside his open jacket and she grabbed a handful of shirt fabric, holding on for dear life. The side of her arm brushed against something very hard, and there was a very brief glimpse of leather before she made the startled identification of <i>holster</i>, followed by <i>gun</i>, then <i>cop</i>. Considering she was in city hall, the conclusion was both logical and inescapable.<br><br>The arm she grabbed turned to iron as the man immediately tensed it to hold her weight; he half-turned, his other arm sliding around her waist to catch her. For a brief moment, no more than the second needed for her to catch her balance, she was held firmly against a very warm, very solid, indisputably male body.<br><br>He released her the moment she was sure-footed, but he didn&#x2019;t back away. Not immediately, anyway. She blew out a shaky breath. &#x201c;Wow. Whew.&#x201d; Her heartbeat, thrown into high gear thanks to the collision and almost falling, was pounding against her rib cage so hard she could feel the thuds. A spill on the floor of city hall would&#x2019;ve been par for the course on this perfectly crappy day, but the last thing she needed right now was to break an ankle or something. Even a sprained ankle, at this point, would throw Premier into a time-crunch they simply wouldn&#x2019;t be able to handle.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;<br><br>He bent his head down as he spoke and his breath, scented with spearmint chewing gum, brushed her temple. His voice was a warm baritone, with a slight rasp that roughened it just enough to take the tone from mellow to something . . . more. She didn&#x2019;t know just what that <i>more</i> was, just that it was there&#x2014; Wait a minute. Had he just called her <i>ma&#x2019;am</i>?<br><br>Did she look <i>that</i> haggard?<br><br>Jaclyn squashed her initial annoyed reaction. The badge he wore explained the &#x201c;ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Actually, being almost anywhere in the South explained it. He wasn&#x2019;t commenting on her appearance; he was a cop, a civil servant on his best behavior. She blew out another breath, and realized she hadn&#x2019;t yet released her grip on either his arm or his shirt. He <i>couldn&#x2019;t </i>step back, not as long as she clung to him. She forced her fingers to unclench from both shirt and arm, and she took the necessary step back to put some distance between them.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; she said as she looked up at him. &#x201c;Thanks for catching me. I wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to where I was going.&#x201d; A small part of her brain, the part reserved for hormones and irrational decisions, gave a wolf whistle. Abruptly she felt both over-heated and overexcited. Damn, he was fine-looking, in a way that wasn&#x2019;t at all boyish and depended more on strength and an air of competency than it did on regular features. There were boys, and there were men. This was a <i>man</i>. This was a man who had <i>it,</i> that indefinable quality of sex appeal, maturity, and strength all mingled together into a potent whole.<br><br>He gave a slight smile, a nice and natural, easy curve of his lips. &#x201c;Not the best layout here, as far as traffic goes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mention <i>traffic</i> to me,&#x201d; Jaclyn said, almost under her breath.<br><br>He shot a quick glance of comprehension in the direction from which she&#x2019;d come, and his smile widened a little. She liked that smile more than she should.<br><br>In her line of business, Jaclyn met a lot of men; unfortunately, they were usually about to get married. Not always, of course, but it took something special to get her attention this way: a certain look, an unexpected chemistry . . . and to be honest, it had been a very long time since she&#x2019;d had the time to admire any man.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t have time now, either. She had to really hurry, or she&#x2019;d be late.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks again. Sorry I almost smashed you flat.&#x201d; She gave the polite cop a quick nod of her head, a friendly&#x2014;but not <i>too</i> friendly&#x2014;good-bye, then looked around for her dropped briefcase.<br><br>The case had spun all the way across the wide hall, coming to a stop against the far wall. Before she could reach for it, a man in stained jeans and a dingy T-shirt stretched tight over an enormous beer belly laboriously bent down and picked up the case. &#x201c;Here ya go, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said, holding the slender case out to her in one meaty paw and smiling a ridiculously sweet smile for such a rough face.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Jaclyn said as she gripped the handle, giving the burly guy a warmer smile than she&#x2019;d given the cop, because she wasn&#x2019;t attracted to him at all, so being nice to him didn&#x2019;t seem as dangerous as being nice to the cop. As she strode away down the hall she mused on how cock-eyed that reasoning was, on a logical basis, but how rock solid it was on some gut-level feminine instinct. She didn&#x2019;t have time for the cop, didn&#x2019;t have time to be attracted to him, so she wasn&#x2019;t about to do anything that might attract him.<br><br>As she walked away, she was almost certain that he was watching her, but she didn&#x2019;t dare turn around to look. She didn&#x2019;t <i>need</i> to turn around; she could practically feel the bull&#x2019;s-eye his gaze was painting on her back.<br><br>She hurried out to the parking lot, using her remote to unlock her steel-gray Jaguar just before she reached it. In almost one motion she opened the door, tossed her briefcase onto the passenger seat, and slid behind the wheel. Her first action then was to hit the door lock, a safety precaution she&#x2019;d taken so often it was second nature to her now. As she turned the key with one hand, she was pulling the seat belt into place with the other.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t need another ticket, so she kept an eye on the speedometer. She especially wasn&#x2019;t going to speed on the way to a meeting with Carrie Edwards; it was all she could do to keep the car hea...</p><h2>Where's My Christmas Stocking: A Lift &amp; Touch Book</h2><p>A kitten&#39;s search for her Christmas stocking introduces readers to a variety of textures and the scent of holiday cookies</p><p></p><h2>Transitional Wares and Their Forerunners</h2><p>Text in English and Chinese.

Now British Intelligence agent Nick Stone and "runner" (and former lover) Sarah Greenwood have become the hunted, racing deeper into a dark, deadly conspiracy that will change the course of world events - and the lives of millions.<br><br>With seventeen years of active service in the elite SAS force, Andy McNab writes from his own harrowing experiences. Packed with authentic procedural details, as relentless as a fast-burning fuse, Crisis Four is a thriller so gritty and real that you won't know where fact ends and fiction begins.</p><p>Andy McNab's British intelligence agent, Nick Stone, is enough of a rebel to be denied a permanent place on the SAS roster, but he's dragooned into a freelance assignment with an ultimatum from his former employers. He's to find Sarah Greenwood, a missing agent who's thought to have defected from the service to aid Muslim militants intent on blowing up the world, or go to prison and also lose the only other female he's ever loved besides Sarah: a 9-year-old girl whose dead parents, Nick's closest friends, left her in his care. <p> Nick manages to locate Sarah without much difficulty, but when he's ordered to kill her, he has a change of heart. The hunter turns into the hunted, as Nick and Sarah flee her hiding place in the North Carolina woods and try to outwit the police, the intelligence services, and a team of assassins directed by Osama bin Laden. As they make their way to Washington to preempt a plan to kill Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu, Nick tries to sort out his conflicted feelings about Sarah. Is she part of bin Laden's team, a so-called runner who's a threat to the CIA and the SAS, or is she a loyal operative trying to outwit a highly placed traitor in the White House? <i>Crisis Four</i> is strong on its depiction of agents in the field; McNab excels at describing every last detail of the hunt, the chase, the kill. One can almost see this former SAS agent replaying scenes from his own past and struggling to get them right: </p><blockquote>I raised the arrow in the air again and rammed it down hard. It hit against the bone again, but this time it slid off and lodged deeper into his neck. I felt him stiffen, his muscle tensing up to resist the penetration. The gardening glove gave a good grip as I pushed harder, twisting the arrow shaft to maximize the damage. I was hoping to cut into his carotid artery or spinal cord, or even find a gap to penetrate his cranium, but instead I ended up severing his windpipe. Now I had to hold him as he asphyxiated, try to stop his body-jerking from getting out of hand and becoming noisy as I waited for him to die. His movements gradually subsided to no more than a spasmodic twitching in his legs. The last reserve of strength he'd found as he saw his life slowly get darker was now exhausted. I could see dark blood oozing out of the wound; it followed along the shaft of the arrow to my glove and dripped onto the floor. When I moved my arm away from his mouth he made no sound.</blockquote> The explosive denouement in the White House bowling alley ultimately reveals Sarah's true colors. It comes as no surprise to anyone except Nick, but it caps a terrific suspense story written by an author who clearly knows what he's about. <i>--Jane Adams</i><br>"MCNAB IS THE BEST SUSPENSE THRILLER WRITER TO PUT PEN TO PAPER SINCE ALISTAIR MACLEAN."<br>--STEPHEN COONTS<br> Author of Flight of the Intruder<br></p><h2>Tunnel in the Sky</h2><p>A group of students goes through the gate to an unknown planet for a two-to-ten-day final exam in Advanced Survival only to realize, after a period of fighting the elements and wildlife, that something has gone wrong with the gate and what was a brief survival exam has become an endless struggle for life.

Wilson's book may purport to be a biography of Paul, but it is really an argument about the origin and nature of Christianity. His premise is that "Jesus was a devoted Jew who did not seek to found a new religion, but to call his followers to a stricter observance of Judaism." It was Paul, not Jesus, who exemplified the central tensions of Christianity. ("Jewish or non-Jewish? Roman or anti-Roman? Apocalyptic or practical?") And according to Wilson, it was Paul who first claimed Jesus' divinity and called Jesus the messiah. Wilson's argument, though heterodox, is no hatchet-job. Paul may be "widely regarded as someone who distorted the original message of Christianity, by adding 'theology' to the supposedly simple message of love Jesus preached," but Wilson sees Paul as "a prophet of liberty, whose visionary sense of the importance of the inner life anticipates the Romantic poets more than the rule-books of the Inquisition." Wilson concludes that Christianity is "an institutionalised distortion of Paul's thought, the inevitable consequence of the world having lasted ... more than nineteen hundred years longer than he predicted." Wilson's prose is just this lively and provocative throughout, and his observations are always skeptical and forgiving: "Paul did not imagine that there would be such a thing as Christianity, or Christian civilization, any more than Jesus did." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>A.

Gordon Kaufman takes up this challenge in this bold, speculative work. <p>Despite the fabled difficulties of traditional Christological terms, few theologians since Tillich and Teilhard have sought to re-envision the symbol of Jesus within the contemporary scientific worldview. Building on his notion of God as simply creativity, Kaufman here locates the meaning of Jesus salvific story within an evolving universe and a threatened planet. </p><p>Outside the dualistic categories of the biblical worldview, he finds, the enormously creative and influential figure of the historic Jesus can have a vital role in the emergence and development of the cosmos and human history. Within that role, he argues, Jesus, his relation to God, and his centrality to Christian faith become clearer and our own lives</p></p><p>Gordon D.

His many important theological works include God-Mystery-Divinity (1996, 0-8006-2959-0) and In the beginning....Creativity (2004,0-8006-3684-8).This book contributes significantly to discussing: (1) Why cannot &#34;serendipitous,&#34; which actually becomes personal in the human embodiment of it where human freedom and creativity coalesce, be itself personal? (2) Why cannot one hope for eternal life, if one can hope for a better human future on the basis of &#34;creativity&#39;s record? --Robert Haight, Union Theological Seminary, New York</p><h2>Morris Minor Traveller: The Complete Companion</h2><p><p>For more than half a century the Morris Minor Traveller has been a familiar feature of rural and small-town Britain. Unpretentious, uncomplaining, half-timbered in an age of sleek pressed steel, Travellers were to be seen everywhere, laden with schoolchildren, dogs, jumble for the jumble sale, buzzing bravely along at no great speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ray Newell is the unchallenged authority on Minor matters, and here he begins by providing in-depth descriptions of the 803cc, 948cc and 1098cc Traveller models, with details of production and specification changes. Next he looks at special purpose versions as used by, among others, the armed forces, the coastguard and even the Barbados police. Then comes a section on one-off Travellers including an intriguing three-door conversion first built in the early 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countless Traveller owners have had to face the need for replacement of the timber framework of the body, a major undertaking, and an outstanding feature of this book is the chapter by Steve Forman devoted to this task, which is set out in step-by-step format with accompanying photographs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final section of the book deals with upgrades available to bring the Minor&#x2019;s performance, braking and suspension up to more modern standards. These include engine replacements, five-speed gearboxes and disc brakes as well as less radical modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With some 300 colour and black-and-white illustrations accompanying the text, this is truly the owner&#x2019;s complete companion to the Minor Traveller.</p></p><p><p><b>Ray Newell</b> is a well known and respected figure within Morris Minor circles.

Of course during these years he fulfilled several distinct roles: academic theologian and teacher, leading protagonist for the Confessing Church, pastor, seminary director and - most dramatically and controversially - willing participant in the German resistance and the conspiracy to overthrow Hitler. But it is his commitment and active involvement in the ecumenical movement that forms the most continuous thread of his life and activity, and links all his various engagements. Equally, the challenge that he laid down to that movement in his time remains a legacy which has still to be fully claimed by the ecumenical world today.&#34; -- from the Preface *** &#34;One of my theological heroes is German Lutheran martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer. What I have not known but learned by reading Keith Clements&#39; new book, Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#39;s Ecumenical Quest, was how important Catholicism was in shaping his view of the church universal and, indeed, his own theology. So now those of us who have long seen Bonhoeffer as a model of how to stand against evil in tortuous times can add to that picture Bonhoeffer as a model for how to learn from and engage with a faith tradition different from our own.&#34; -- Bill Tammeus, National Catholic Reporter, June 2015 [Subject: Religious Studies, Christianity, Biography]</p><p></p><h2>Charles Willson Peale and His World</h2><p>Traces the life of the eighteenth-century artist, Charles Wilson Peale, discusses his study of natural history, and examines his paintings of American society.</p><p></p><h2>The Osterman Weekend</h2><p>In Zurich. . .in Moscow. . .in Washington.

The novel is based on the true story of a labor and delivery nurse who was prohibited from caring for a newborn because the father requested that no African-American nurses tend to his baby. In the fictional version, Ruth, the African-American nurse in question, finds herself on trial for events related to the same request made by a white supremacist father. Using the narratives of Ruth, the baby&#x2019;s father, and the female public defender who takes Ruth&#x2019;s case, Picoult examines multiple facets of racism. The topic of race in America is difficult to talk about, but in in an honest and revealing way Picoult allows readers to draw their own conclusions about how we see ourselves and others in the world. <em>Small Great Things</em> is an important and thought-provoking novel about power and prejudice that deserves to be read, digested, and shared with others. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em>Jodi Picoult is the author of twenty-four internationally bestselling novels, including My Sister&#39;s Keeper, House Rules and The Storyteller, and has also co-written two YA books with her daughter Samantha van Leer, Between the Lines and Off the Page.

Seven months later, a handful of half-starved survivors returned with a story that shocked the entire nation. . . .<br><br></b>In the dark, divisive years following the Civil War, America&#x2019;s foremost Arctic explorer, Charles Francis Hall, became a figure of national pride and renown when he embarked on a harrowing, landmark expedition. With financial backing from Congress and the personal support of President Grant, Captain Hall and his crew boarded the <i>Polaris</i>, a steam schooner carefully refitted for its rigorous journey, and began their quest to be the first men to reach the North Pole.<br><br>Hall was a veteran of the Arctic and a man of great physical stamina, but all his strength and experience couldn&#x2019;t combat the conflicts brewing among his officers and crew.

Neither the ship nor its captain would ever return.<br><br>As the expedition reached its most crucial stage, Hall inexplicably sickened and died. Whispers of murder swept through the ship. Still, the <i>Polaris </i>forged on, only to meet with a further disaster that left half the crew separated from the ship and most of their supplies at the bottom of the ocean. What followed was a horrifying, seven-month ordeal through the heart of an Arctic winter, when men fought starvation, madness, and each other upon the ever-shifting ice.<br><br><i>Trial by Ice </i>is an incredible adventure that pits men against the natural elements and their own fragile human nature. Beyond this, it is also an authentic murder mystery that, in its time, led to accusations of foul play and a dramatic, unresolved investigation.

It preoccupies our popular culture, our fantasies, and even our moralizing&#x2014;&#x201c;You <i>still</i> eat meat?&#x201d; With our top chefs as deities and finest restaurants as places of pilgrimage, we have made food the stuff of secular seeking and transcendence, finding heaven in a mouthful. But have we come any closer to discovering the true meaning of food in our lives?<br> &nbsp;<br> With inimitable charm and learning, Adam Gopnik takes us on a beguiling journey in search of that meaning as he charts America&#x2019;s recent and rapid evolution from commendably aware eaters to manic, compulsive gastronomes. It is a journey that begins in eighteenth-century France&#x2014;the birthplace of our modern tastes (and, by no coincidence, of the restaurant)&#x2014;and carries us to the kitchens of the White House, the molecular meccas of Barcelona, and beyond. To understand why so many of us apparently live to eat, Gopnik delves into the most burning questions of our time, including: Should a Manhattanite bother to find chicken killed in the Bronx? Is a great vintage really any better than a good bottle of wine? And: Why does dessert matter so much?<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout, he reminds us of a time-honored truth often lost amid our newfound gastronomic pieties and certitudes: What goes on the table has never mattered as much to our lives as what goes on around the table&#x2014;the scene of families, friends, lovers coming together, or breaking apart; conversation across the simplest or grandest board. This, ultimately, is who we are.<br> &nbsp;<br> Following in the footsteps of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, Adam Gopnik gently satirizes the entire human comedy of the comestible as he surveys the wide world of taste that we have lately made our home. <i>The Table Comes First</i> is the delightful beginning of a new conversation about the way we eat now.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: Adam Gopnik again demonstrates his considerable talents in <i>The Table Comes First</i>, a collection of musings on one of his favorite subjects: food. Fans of <em>Paris to the Moon</em> and <em>Through the Children&#x2019;s Gate</em> know that Gopnik is a true gourmand whose tastes have been refined in the kitchen with his friend Alice Waters, on the velvet banquettes of Parisian bistros, and at chaotic New York City takeout counters. These essays cover a broad range of food-related topics, including the origins of the modern restaurant and the arguments for and against eating meat. But Gopnik&#x2019;s overarching mission is to celebrate the pleasures of sitting around a table and sharing a meal with family and friends--a pleasure, he notes, that is at once universal and deeply personal. It is at this intersection of macro and micro where Gopnik&#x2019;s insatiable intellect and warmth are best displayed. <i>--Juliet Disparte</i>Author of the beloved best seller <i>Paris to the Moon,</i> <b>Adam Gopnik</b> has been writing for <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1986.

This single-engine, all-metal aircraft was ordered by the Ministry of Supply during the darkest days of World War II when the lethal German combination of Junkers Ju.87 Stuka and Panzer tank forces had conquered most of Europe in a campaign that lasted a mere few weeks and the invasion of Britain was considered imminent.<br><br>The RAF had invented the dive-bomber concept in 1917 but had consistently rejected it in the inter-war period with the obsession of heavy bombing predominating official thinking almost exclusively. By the time the Vengeance arrived a still-reluctant RAF was seeking a precision bomber to prevent a repeat of the Japanese Naval attacks in the Indian Ocean and six squadrons were set up to counter this threat. With the Japanese on the borders of Burma and India, these aircraft, no longer required for the original role, proved by far and away the most accurate bomber aircraft operated by the British up to that time.<br><br>The Allied Armies on the ground, including Orde Wingate&#x2019;s Chindits, clamored for their continued use and considered them essential, but in vain, and by 1945 all had been replaced.

Thomas (whose monosyllabic first name could easily stand for Calvinist) trains his fire on two targets: ``the secular, libertine vision'' of the tuned-in, turned-on 1960s and the havoc that vision subsequently wrought upon an America Thomas idealizes as ``the virtuous, religious republic of our history.'' Relying mainly on anecdotal evidence, he offers a heartfelt, deadly earnest jeremiad detailing how the radical anti-establishment precepts embraced by many baby boomers in their salad days have endured--and helped to undermine traditional values. Thomas accuses boomers of having unwarranted confidence in big government's capacity to solve socioeconomic problems and of harboring ruinously permissive attitudes toward drugs, pornography, sex, and even violent crime. While he fulminates effectively against abortion on demand, no- fault divorce, single-parent families, homosexual marriages, socialized medicine, Hillary Clinton, declining rates of literacy and numeracy, and cultural/gender sensibilities run riot. Thomas has a pro-active program of his own. In brief, the author's ethic centers on what he views as the bedrock graces and verities of Western civilization: church, family, community, discipline, self- sufficiency, industry, individual initiative, objective standards of good and evil, and above all, an abiding faith in God. On occasion, the author sounds like a herald of theocracy: ``Values, personal and national, must be drummed into children so they will think and act in ways that promote American interests, and their own.'' For the most part, however, Thomas proves an articulate, principled spokesman for the conservative agenda. The text includes an awesomely self-congratulatory foreword from Rush Limbaugh.

Craig</b> is professor emeritus in literature at Wheelock College in Boston. He is the author of thirteen J. W. Jackson/Martha's Vineyard mysteries, most recently <i>Vineyard Shadows.</i> He lives on Martha's Vineyard.<p><b>Chapter One: J.W.</b> </p><p> I had arranged to meet James Bannerman in the Fireside because it was close to the ferry landing, so he could catch the boat and go home to Connecticut after we talked. I was the only customer when he came in. He was a medium-sized guy in his mid-forties. He had flat, dark eyes and hair, and he looked in shape. He wore white-collar clothes. He glanced around, saw only me and the bartender and Bonzo wiping tables in the corner of the room. He came over to the bar. </p><p> "Are you Jackson?" </p><p> "My friends call me J.W." </p><p> The bartender drifted down while Bannerman and I were shaking hands. Bannerman pointed at my glass of Sam Adams. "Bring a couple more of those to us over in that booth, please." The "please" softened it, but it was clear that Bannerman was used to giving orders. </p><p> Bannerman and I went to the booth. He shoved a photograph at me. "That's her. That's my wife, my Katherine." </p><p> The photo was of an attractive blonde woman about my age, which made her only a few years younger than Bannerman. I drank from my glass. "Look," I said, "I'm only here because Jason Thornberry asked me to meet you. We've worked together a couple of times before, but like I told him on the phone, I don't think I'm the right man for this job. Your wife is legally separated from you, so where she goes and what she does is her own business." </p><p> "Don't say that. I'm desperate. Thornberry's people finally managed to trace her this far last year, but then they lost her. She was here on the Vineyard, but then she dropped out of sight just before Labor Day. I've been here several times this summer, trying to find her, but my work won't let me stay long. You're my last chance." </p><p> "You really need a professional. I haven't been a cop for years. I'm retired. If you don't think Thornberry Security can do the job, you should hire some other private investigator, but I think Thornberry is about as good an outfit as you'll find." </p><p> "Money's no problem, if that's what's holding you back. I've got plenty. And I don't need some other PI, I need you. Thornberry himself recommended you. He said he's been trying for years to get you to work for him, but you won't. He says you live here, you know the people, and you know this island. He says local knowledge might make the difference. Don't let me down. Please. I love Katherine. I have to find her!" </p><p> He dug out a handkerchief and wiped his face. I let myself feel sorry for him and looked at the photo again. He mentioned a sum of money that was large enough to capture my attention. When you live on Martha's Vineyard and don't have a regular job, you always need money. </p><p> "Maybe she's still here on the Vineyard," he said. "We honeymooned here, and she loved the place. I think that's why she came back here. Maybe she's living here, using another name. If she is, I want you to find her. If she's gone, find out where she went. Please." </p><p> Bannerman was a tough-looking man, but he wasn't acting tough at all. He looked like he wanted to cry. I wondered if he was an amateur thespian, pulling my strings, or if he was one of those people who fool themselves about their own virtue, or if he was really as concerned as he was acting. I had no real reason to think it wasn't the latter. </p><p> I thought of the things I was planning to do. Fishing in the annual Derby was highest on the list. I was tired of being the only surf caster on Martha's Vineyard who had never caught a forty-pound bass. </p><p> "Look," said Bannerman, leaning forward, "if Katherine doesn't want to see me, that's fine. All I really want to know is that she's well and happy. I love her. Frankie, that's our daughter, loves her. Kathy's the most important thing in the world to us. Please help me." </p><p> His words were consistent with feelings I also had. I was in love with my wife. If Zee ever left me, I'd be miserable, but I'd want her to be happy. </p><p> "Please," said Bannerman for the fourth or fifth time. </p><p> I didn't want the job, but unlike Sam Spade I was a sap when it came to love or its appearance. </p><p> "All right," I said. "I'll see what I can do. But don't get your hopes up. If Thornberry Security can't find her, the chances are that I can't either. And a couple of other things. I can't spend all of my time on this job. I have other commitments. And if I do find her, it'll be up to her whether or not I tell you where she is. I'll tell you if I find her, but I may not tell you where." </p><p> "Thank you," said Bannerman. "I appreciate your help more than I can say." He wiped his face again and put the handkerchief away. I poured more beer into my glass and drank it. It was cool and smooth. </p><p> "Here," said Bannerman, who had been digging in his briefcase. He put a checkbook on the table and handed me a large envelope. "In there you'll find all of the information I gave Thornberry when they went to work for me and all that they've given me since. Maybe there's something there that will help you. If you need to know more, let me know, and I'll tell you what I can." While I pulled a file from the envelope and glanced at it, he scribbled a check and pushed it at me. It was too much, but if that was fine with him, it was fine with me, so I didn't make an issue of it. </p><p> "I'll look at this later," I said, pushing the file back into its envelope, "but you can tell me some things right now. First, why did she leave?" </p><p> He'd heard the question before, probably from both his local police and certainly from Thornberry, since detectives in both agencies would understand that husbands usually know why their wives disappear. </p><p> "I honestly don't know," he said, looking me right in the eye. "We had our ups and downs like everybody else, but nothing serious. Then one morning after I went to the office, she just drove away from our house there in Hartford and I haven't seen her since. The neighbors saw her go. She was alone. That was a year ago last spring. I've been looking for her ever since, but all I've found out is that she was here on the Vineyard last summer." </p><p> "You never heard from her?" </p><p> "Our daughter, Frankie, got a postcard from her about a week after she left. It was mailed from New York City. It said she was fine and not to worry. That was all." </p><p> "I might want to talk with people you know. That includes your family and friends and the people you work with." </p><p> He nodded, then frowned. "Do you have to talk with our daughter? This business has upset her terribly." </p><p> "If I do, I'll try to make it painless." </p><p> "I'd rather you didn't do it at all. Frankie's a freshman at UConn, and she's got the jitters about that on top of this other thing." He rubbed his forehead. "This is a terrible situation. I'm afraid something has happened to Kathy. Otherwise I'm sure we'd have heard from her." </p><p> "I'll see what I can do, but, like I said, you shouldn't get your hopes too high." </p><p> We finished our beers and he went away. I ordered another and drank it while I looked over the file he'd left. Thornberry Security had been thorough and their information was useful. About the only thing I could do that they hadn't already done was talk to some people they hadn't interviewed here on the island. </p><p> Tomorrow was soon enough for that. Today I had to get ready for the Derby and meet Brady Coyne when he came down from Boston. Brady used his law practice to support his fishing habit, and his plan was to combine some fly fishing in the Derby with some legal work for Sarah Fairchild, who owned two hundred acres up on the north shore overlooking Vineyard Sound. </p><p> My father and Sarah had met before I was born, and Sarah had taken to him enough to give him, and after his death me, lifetime access to Fairchild Cove, which consisted of Fairchild Point and Fairchild Beach, and which was one of the best bass-fishing and bluefishing spots on the island. </p><p> But now Sarah was old, and Brady was going to help her decide what to do with her estate. The very idea of trying to deal with that can of worms made me glad I wasn't a lawyer. </p><p> I left the Fireside, pushed Katherine Bannerman to the back of my mind, and headed home, thinking Derby thoughts. In September the bluefish are back, heading south after their summer sojourn to cooler northern waters, and to celebrate this return and to extend the tourist season, the Vineyard hosts a month-long fishing derby from the middle of September to the middle of October. Hundreds of fishermen and fisherwomen come over from America and join island anglers in pursuit of striped bass, bluefish, bonito, and false albacore. Local plumbers, carpenters, landscapers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, and chiefs close up shop and go fishing. They become haggard and thin as they lose sleep and money to chase fish, and their customers grow surly when they're unable to find anyone to do work for them. In mid-October, when the Derby ends, normalcy returns and you can finally get somebody to rake your lawn or fix that leaky pipe in your basement. </p><p> The Derby thrives in spite of the increasing difficulty fishermen have getting to traditional angling spots. The problem is a familiar one in all resort communities, where local land is owned by outside people. On Martha's Vineyard, more and more off-islanders, both individuals and corporations, are buying property and closing off access routes to the woods and shore. NO TRESPASSING signs are tacked on locked gates that previously were open to fishermen and hunters. Local folks, who once felt welcome to cast a line or pop a cap almost anywhere on the Vineyard, now can't get close to hunting stands or fishing spots. Only a lucky few, like me, have permission to open gates and cross private lands. I was happy to be among the chosen, although I wasn't sure how much longer my privileges would last. </p><p> I spent the early afternoon with Zee on our screened porch lubricating our reels, replacing rusty hooks with new ones, and checking lines and leaders and rods. Katherine Bannerman refused to stay out of my mind, so while we worked I told Zee about the job I'd taken. </p><p> "People don't just leave without a reason," said Zee. "If you find out why she left, maybe you can find out where she went. What did you think of Bannerman?" </p><p> "I'm not sure. People wear different faces in different situations. I'm pretty certain he wants to find her, because he's spent a lot of time and money trying to do it. But on the other hand, he's made a lot of money in the last few years, so he can afford to finance an expensive search even if it's just for appearances." </p><p> "Is there another woman in his life?" </p><p> "None that Thornberry found." </p><p> "How about another man in hers?" </p><p> "No, but apparently she likes to dance and socialize more than her husband does, and it was a point of contention between them. According to Thornberry, Bannerman is either at the office or at home getting rested up so he can go back to the office. She wanted more than that in her life. Is that enough to send her packing, do you think?" </p><p> "Could be. Maybe she was having a midlife crisis." </p><p> "I thought only men had those. They divorce their wives and go off with blonde bimbos." </p><p> "It happens to both genders. The difference is, nowadays more women have enough money to leave boring hubbies. That wasn't always the case." </p><p> When our gear was in good shape, I drove with the kids to Fairchild Cove to make a few practice casts with each of the rods while Zee stayed home to wash her hair and muck out the guest room for Brady. The master plan was for us to take Brady, between lawyering stints, with us as we roamed the beaches in search of that prizewinning fish. </p><p> Joshua and Diana and I drove up to Vineyard Haven and managed to make a left turn at the infamous Tee intersection of State Road and the Edgartown Road, the site of one of the three worst permanent traffic jams on the island, the other two occurring at the Five Corners near the Vineyard Haven ferry docks and between Al's Package Store and the A&amp;P in Edgartown. Smart Vineyard Haven cops do nothing to correct the situations at the Tee or at the Five Corners, because the traffic jams slow cars to a crawl, which is the speed for which island roads are constructed. The jams, of course, are caused by people making left turns. I've been pointing this out for years, but does anybody listen? No. When I'm king of the world, I'm banning left turns. </p><p> We drove to West Tisbury, then turned into the narrow, sandy driveway that led to the Fairchild place. A hundred yards along, a smaller lane split off to the right. We took that and came to a locked gate. I had the key. </p><p> "How come there's a gate, Pa?" asked Joshua. </p><p> "Because the people who own the land don't want other people to come in." </p><p> "How come you have a key?" </p><p> "Because we're special." </p><p> The lane led down to Fairchild Cove. It wound through the trees and past some big rocks left behind by the glacier that, before its eventual retreat back north, had created the Vineyard, Nantucket, Long Island, and other south coastal islands by pushing part of what is now New Hampshire down into what is now the sea. On the far side of the big rocks, we curled over a rise and dropped down toward the shore. </p><p> "Look, Pa. A haunted house." Diana pointed. </p><p> It did look something like a haunted house. Actually, it was the stone cottage that some nineteenth-century Fairchild male had built as a hunting and fishing lodge for himself and his buddies. As cottages go, it was pretty fair-sized, and in its day it had all of the amenities. But for as long as I had been driving to the cove, the place had been in ruins and, as empty and abandoned houses do, it had taken on an increasingly forsaken air. Maybe it <i>was</i> haunted. According to tales I'd heard in my youth, it had never been used again after the drowning death of one of the Fairchild buddies who had been staying there with his fishing pals. The victim had, it was said, been done in by that familiar fisherman's notion that they're biting better over there than over here. He had waded out to the rocks at the tip of Fairchild Point, been trapped by the rising tide, and had drowned trying to get back to shore. </p><p> Whether his ghost still hung around the cottage was something I'd never thought of until my daughter's remark. Maybe Diana was psychic. </p><p> "I don't think that it's haunted," I said, "but it does look scary." </p><p> "No," insisted little Diana. "It's haunted, all right. It's got ghosts." </p><p> I glanced at her and she looked up at me. "Don't worry, Pa. They're not bad ghosts. You don't have to be scared of them." </p><p> The lane turned and we left the cottage behind us and came to the beach. Fairchild Point was to the west. Reaching out from its tip was the underwater sandbar that the drowned fisherman had followed to the fatal rocks that lay thirty yards out in the sound. The beach curved east to other rocks lying at the foot of the embankment that formed that end of the shallow cove. Out across the sound I could see the Elizabeth Islands and Tarpaulin Cove, where I had anchored more than once while cruising in the <i>Shirley J.</i> </p><p> There was a battered pickup truck parked in front of us, and fifty yards to our ...</p></p><h2>Jade Island</h2><p>Kyle Donovan has freed himself from the constraints of his father's high-powered global trading empire to turn his passion for adventure into a livelihood, roving the world as a treasure hunter for his own business, Donovan Gems and Minerals.

Their Mass was banned, their priests were outlawed, their faith was criminalised. In an age of assassination and Armada, those Catholics who clung to their faith were increasingly seen as the enemy within. In this superb history, award-winning author Jessie Childs explores the Catholic predicament in Elizabethan England through the eyes of one remarkable family: the Vauxes of Harrowden Hall.&nbsp;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Traitors</i> is a tale of dawn raids and daring escapes, stately homes and torture chambers, ciphers, secrets and lies. From clandestine chapels and side-street inns to exile communities and the corridors of power, it exposes the tensions and insecurities masked by the cult of Gloriana. Above all, it is a timely story of courage and frailty, repression and reaction and the terrible consequences when religion and politics collide.</p><p>JESSIE CHILDS is an award-winning author. Born in 1976, she took a history first from Oxford and won the Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography with her debut <i>Henry VIII's Last Victim</i>.

She is presumed dead by those on the "outside," but Sarah's spirit is still very much alive.

Across the room, behind a big wooden desk, sat the chief speechwriter for the president of the United States, scrutinizing my r�sum�.</p><p>Decades earlier, perhaps during the Johnson years, the couch on which I sat had begun its life as a handsome piece of furniture. But after bearing the brunt of many administrations and more than a few crises, its springs were spent. If I leaned back, I&#x2019;d be swallowed by cushions. If I scooched forward, I might end up on the floor. On edge, I waited.</p><p>Only a day earlier, I had been sitting in my fifth-floor walk-up apartment in Dupont Circle&#x2014;unshaven, unemployed, and uncertain about my future. The call from the White House had caught me by surprise. While I had worked for several years as a speechwriter on Capitol Hill and had twice applied to become a presidential speechwriter, I hadn&#x2019;t been selected. Now one of the president&#x2019;s speechwriters was moving on, and there was an opening. Would I come in for an interview?</p><p>When the chief speechwriter, Terry Edmonds, finally looked up, he pushed his glasses to the top of his head. &#x201c;Your writing is good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have no doubt you can do the job. But you have a lot of other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He paused, searching for the right word. &#x201c;You have a lot of other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. projects. What is this <i>cork boat</i>?&#x201d; The way he said those words, I knew it wasn&#x2019;t just a question but something of a challenge.</p><p>He was asking about the last line on my r�sum�: <i>Currently building the world&#x2019;s first cork boat.</i> I explained that I was saving a hundred thousand wine-bottle corks to build a boat modeled after a Viking ship, which I planned to take on a voyage through French wine country. Building the boat had been a boyhood dream, and I was determined to see it through.</p><p>As Edmonds&#x2019; eyes narrowed, I could feel my last chance to work at the White House ebbing away. But at that moment, as both my career and I teetered on the edge of that couch, an analogy sprang to mind.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, building a cork boat is a lot like writing a good speech.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Edmonds&#x2019; head tilted; his eyebrows rose. It was too late to retreat. &#x201c;In both cases,&#x201d; I explained, &#x201c;you take a jumble of small things&#x2014;corks or words&#x2014;that don&#x2019;t do much on their own. But if you assemble them carefully, and put them into just the right order, they&#x2019;ll carry you on the most amazing journey.&#x201d;</p><p>And then I shut up.</p><p>For a long moment, Edmonds stared at me. Then a grin spread across his face, and he shook his head in grudging admiration&#x2014;not for my nautical ambitions, but for my escape. He got the analogy, and I got the job.</p><p>A dozen years later, when I set out to write this book, I intended to explore the subtle yet powerful role of analogy in persuasion. Because while they often operate unnoticed, analogies aren&#x2019;t accidents, they&#x2019;re arguments&#x2014;arguments that, like icebergs, conceal most of their mass and power beneath the surface. In many arguments, whoever has the best analogy wins.</p><p>But as my research progressed, it became clear that analogies do more than just persuade; they also play a catalytic role in innovation and decision making&#x2014;often with dramatic consequences. From the bloody Chicago slaughterhouse that inspired Henry Ford&#x2019;s first moving assembly line, to the &#x201c;domino theory&#x201d; that led America into the Vietnam War, to the &#x201c;bicycle for the mind&#x201d; that Steve Jobs envisioned as a Macintosh computer, analogies have played a dynamic role in shaping the world around us.</p><p>Despite analogy&#x2019;s importance, many people have only a vague sense of its definition. In broad terms, an analogy is simply a comparison that asserts a parallel&#x2014;explicit or implicit&#x2014;between two distinct things, based on the perception of a shared property or relation. In everyday use, analogies actually appear in many forms. Some of these include metaphors, similes, political slogans, legal arguments, marketing taglines, mathematical formulas, biblical parables, logos, TV ads, euphemisms, proverbs, fables, and sports clich�s.</p><p>Wearing such disguises, analogies can play a much bigger role than most people recognize. Not just because analogies make arguments, but because they often trigger emotions that override the circuits of reason, and sometimes at a subconscious level. All day every day, in fact, we make or evaluate one analogy after the other, because such comparisons are the only practical way to sort a flood of incoming data, place it within the context of our experience, and make decisions accordingly.</p><p>The investor Warren Buffett, known for his rich use of analogy, has noted that &#x201c;You never know who&#x2019;s swimming naked until the tide goes out.&#x201d; In other words, when times are good, it&#x2019;s easy to look good; when times are hard, weaknesses that were hidden beneath the surface are suddenly exposed. The same could be said for analogies themselves: We never know what assumptions, deceptions, or brilliant insights they might be hiding until we look beneath their surface.</p><p>Despite the ubiquity and impact of analogical thinking, most people are unaware of just how much this core process influences their decision making. Such lack of awareness comes at a cost. Evidence suggests that people who tend to overlook or underestimate analogy&#x2019;s influence often find themselves struggling to make their arguments or achieve their goals. The converse is also true. Those who construct the clearest, most resonant and apt analogies are usually the most successful in reaching the outcomes they seek.</p><p>The ideas in this book draw from the observations, insights, and work of many people, including psychologists, inventors, business leaders, linguists, advertisers, political strategists, legal scholars, neuroscientists, and the world&#x2019;s best pickpocket. A caveat is in order, however. Readers hoping for an exploration of analogy in literature and poetry will not find it in these pages. As rich as those mines are, one could spend a lifetime excavating the metaphors and similes of Shakespeare alone&#x2014;and many scholars have. This book has a different purpose: helping readers use analogies more effectively to innovate and persuade, and helping them get better at spotting analogies that may sound persuasive but are actually deceptive, faulty, or even dangerous.</p><p>Throughout history and across cultures, analogies have animated many of the greatest debates and sparked brilliant discoveries. Similarly, poor analogies have misled many people, companies, and nations into dead ends and disasters. But now, in this age of compounding global challenges, the analogies we embrace&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;will likely produce more serious and lasting consequences. It&#x2019;s in this context that I hope <i>Shortcut</i> helps readers become more adept with analogy, enabling them to sidestep its pitfalls and put its power to good and noble use.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>APPLES TO ORANGES</p><p>How Our Analogical Instinct Fuels Thought</p><p>A confident, square-jawed man is skippering a sailboat when a critical piece of hardware fails, causing the sail to start flapping. As the boat loses headway, the man calmly strips the belt from a spare life vest and uses it to reattach the flapping sail to the boat&#x2019;s long, rigid boom. Filling with wind, the big sail&#x2014;once again stiff&#x2014;carries the boat onward through waters that part like a V.</p><p>The entire incident, depicted in a TV ad, takes less than thirty seconds. And while the analogy between a flapping sail and the ad&#x2019;s subject&#x2014;erectile dysfunction&#x2014;is never explicitly stated by the ad&#x2019;s matter-of-fact narrator, the implicit parallel is clear. Even the name of the advertised drug, Viagra, rhymes with Niagara&#x2014;an awesome physical wonder whose surging white water is at once natural, powerful, and unstoppable. Coincidence? Hardly.</p><p>The utility of the imagery and name depend on the audience&#x2019;s ability, even instinct, to analogize. At its core, this instinct is not just the human urge to seek and compare patterns but to infer abstract concepts from one domain and apply them to another. Unlike other animals (many of which are also able to compare superficial patterns), people can identify and compare domains that have nothing to do with each other except for a common, abstract intellectual scaffolding that we ourselves construct.</p><p>Intrinsically, sailing and erectile dysfunction have nothing to do with each other. But once stripped of their particulars, both domains can be said to share&#x2014;within the context of the ad&#x2014;two common ideas. First, hard is better than soft. Second, controlling a situation is better than a situation controlling you.</p><p>Subtle but strong, the ad suggests a firm congruence between two unrelated domains: Just as a confident captain maintains control of his vessel no matter what, so, too, can the average Joe control <i>his</i> vessel in the stormy seas of love. While the analogy is not explicitly stated, it is nevertheless clear. Given the barest minimum of cultural knowledge, our minds process the sailing analogy unconsciously and instantaneously.</p><p>This is also what we do with the overwhelming majority of data we encounter in daily life. As Leonard Mlodinow notes in <i>Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior</i>, about 95 percent of all thought is unconscious. This is because our senses send our brains roughly eleven million bits of information per second&#x2014;vastly more than our conscious processing capacity, which maxes out at an estimated fifty bits per second. &#x201c;So if your conscious mind were left to process all that incoming information,&#x201d; Mlodinow writes, &#x201c;your brain would freeze like an overtaxed computer.&#x201d;</p><p>But the unconscious brain isn&#x2019;t just discarding all that extra incoming data; it&#x2019;s sorting through it for pattern, contextual relevance, utility, and urgency. A lot of the information we process has to do with keeping the body&#x2019;s many systems running smoothly, no matter what surroundings or activity we may be experiencing at the moment. Much as an apartment building&#x2019;s maintenance team works behind the scenes to keep the furnace, air-conditioning, plumbing, and electrical systems in good order without bothering the tenants, the mind runs most bodily functions without conscious oversight&#x2014;most of the time. Only when a task is particularly taxing, uncomfortable, or urgent does the unconscious call up the head office for direction and additional resources.</p><p>LOG OR CROCODILE?</p><p>Such analogical thinking is as old as humanity. Indeed, without it, we wouldn&#x2019;t be here. Imagine our human ancestors, millions of years ago in East Africa, stopping in the midday heat to drink at a stream. Presumably, those who could more quickly and accurately detect differences in obscure or incomplete patterns&#x2014;such as the knobby brown snout of a submerged crocodile versus a knotty brown protrusion of a submerged log&#x2014;would have done better detecting danger and therefore enjoyed a significant advantage in the struggle for survival. Those who were unable to spot the difference, fill in the missing visual gaps, and infer their potential impact became the crocodile&#x2019;s lunch.</p><p>As noted, we humans aren&#x2019;t the only animals capable of pattern recognition or the quick reactions that follow. Widespread pattern recognition is the reason that camouflage is so common in nature, as animals have adapted to blend in with their surroundings. Other creatures have adopted the opposite strategy, mimicking the appearance of an unappealing or threatening alternative for those who might otherwise eat them. But while many other animals are adept at such comparison, evidence suggests that only humans are capable of using deep analogical thought to identify and exploit conceptual similarities that go beyond the superficial.</p><p>As researchers have explored the function of analogy in human thought, they have found that analogy may lie in the core of all decision making. Psychologists Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander, authors of <i>Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking</i>, are leading experts in the study of analogy. They argue that whether we&#x2019;re ordering food in a new restaurant, looking both ways before crossing a busy street, or deciding that an approaching golden retriever is less threatening than the rottweiler we saw earlier, we&#x2019;re making a series of analogies with past experiences that we&#x2019;ve already categorized for easy reference.</p><p>Such analogizing is so common that we aren&#x2019;t necessarily conscious that we&#x2019;re doing it. And even when incoming data demands higher-order decision making, the unconscious does a lot of screening and organizing before passing on an executive summary for conscious evaluation. To get a better sense of this, think about how the White House processes, evaluates, and filters the thousands of calls, letters, and e-mails from people constantly clamoring for the president&#x2019;s attention. Only a small subset of messages ever reaches the Oval Office for the president&#x2019;s consideration and potential executive action. Yet some, especially those concerning key legislation or urgent matters of national security, receive priority routing.</p><p>Other messages, such as letters from struggling citizens, might be less urgent but still important. And while all the letters the president ends up reading tell stories that are unique in their specifics, they are typically representative examples&#x2014;analogs&#x2014;of hundreds or thousands just like them. In actuality, all those other letters &#x201c;just like&#x201d; them are not identical in every detail. But they share the same gist, and it is in that context that the president makes the intuitive, analogical leap to grasp the deeper truths they reveal about a bigger social, economic, or political narrative.</p><p>Effectively, this is how the brain works. Every day, all of us are constantly evaluating a flood of incoming data&#x2014;sight, sound, touch, smell&#x2014;for their relevance and utility in a wide range of cause-and-effect narratives, which we then use to inform our decision making.</p><p>&#x201c;If one never trusted a single analogy, how could one understand anything in this world? What, other than one&#x2019;s past, can one rely on in grounding decisions that one makes when facing a new situation?&#x201d; Hofstadter and Sander write. &#x201c;And of course all situations<i> are</i> in fact new, from the largest and most abstract ones down to the tiniest and most concrete ones.&#x201d;</p><p>ANALOGIES ARE MODELS</p><p>In essence, analogies are a type of model that can take virtually limitless forms, well beyond the verbal realm. For example, people use mathematics to help model the future in abstract terms&#x2014;numbers and processes&#x2014;that enable them to predict supply and demand in a particular market, explore the ramifications of different retirement plans, or estimate how fast climate change might increase sea levels.</p><p>On a simpler level, envision a child&#x2019;s model train set. However idealized, the image that comes to mind is an analogy of the actual working railroad that inspired it, and serves as a catalyst for imaginary journeys and adventures. Similarly, a bathroom air freshener&#x2019;s pine scent is supposed to be analogous to the smell of a coniferous forest, just as some industrially produced breakfast syr...</p></p><h2>Silver Surfer 4: Citizen of Earth (Marvel Now!)</h2><p>The Surfer has taken Dawn Greenwood to the end of the universe, and now he's going to show her the most fantastic planet of them all: Earth!

She lives in Sebastapol, California.</p>PreS-Gr 1-Originally published as a story in A Hanukkah Treasury (Holt, 1998), this book is only nominally about the holiday. Rewritten and packaged as a picture book, it features a nameless young narrator who describes what it's like living in urban Alaska, where winters are short on daylight and long on snow, and where a hungry moose might choose to eat the trees in your backyard. Several pages into the book, readers learn that it is Hanukkah, but even pretending to be a spinning dreidel in the snow doesn't stop this girl from worrying about the moose, particularly when he gets too close to her swing. On the last night of the holiday, the girl's father takes her outside to behold the aurora borealis, "Our very own Hanukkah Festival of Lights." The glorious colors remind her of melting candles on the menorah, but then once again the girl is distracted by the moose, and finally has the clever idea of luring him out of the yard. Acrylic and gouache illustrations beautifully display the shadowy, rich palette of winter in Alaska, tempered by the glow of candles and the northern lights.-Teri Markson, Los Angeles Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Red demanded, seizing hold of the derelict by the shoulder of his squalid gabardine. <br><br>"What one d'you mean?" the dirt-caked face replied. He was scanning the quartet of young men who'd cornered him with rodent's eyes. The tunnel where they'd found him relieving himself was far from hope of help. They all knew it and so, it seemed, did he. "I don't know what you're talking about."<br><br>"You've been showing yourself to children," Red said.<br><br>The man shook his head, a dribble of spittle running from his lip into the matted bush of his beard. "I've done nothing," he insisted.<br><br>Brendan sauntered across to the man, heavy footsteps hollow in the tunnel. "What's your name?" he inquired, with deceptive courtesy. Though he lacked Red's height and commanding manner, the scar that inscribed Brendan's cheek from temple to jawline suggested he knew suffering, both in the giving and the receiving. "Name," he demanded. "I'm not going to ask you again."<br><br>"Pope," the old man muttered. "Mr. Pope."<br><br>Brendan grinned. "Mr. Pope?" he said. "Well, we heard you've been exposing that rancid little prick of yours to innocent children. What do you say to that?"<br><br>"No," Pope replied, again shaking his head. "That's not true. I never done nothing like that." When he frowned the filth on his face cracked like crazy paving, a second skin of grime which was the accrual of many months. Had it not been for the fragrance of alcohol off him, which obscured the worst of his bodily stench, it would have been nigh on impossible to stand within a yard of him. The man was human refuse, a shame to his species.<br><br>"Why bother with him?" Karney said. "He stinks."<br><br>Red glanced over his shoulder to silence the interruption. At seventeen, Karney was the youngest, and in the quartet's unspoken hierarchy scarcely deserving of an opinion. Recognizing his error, he shut up, leaving Red to return his attention to the vagrant. He pushed Pope back against the wall of the tunnel. The old man expelled a cry as he struck the concrete; it echoed back and forth. Karney, knowing from past experience how the scene would go from here, moved away and studied a gilded cloud of gnats on the edge of the tunnel. Though he enjoyed being with Red and the other two -- the camaraderie, the petty larceny, the drinking -- this particular game had never been much to his taste. He couldn't see the sport in finding some drunken wreck of a man like Pope and beating what little sense was left in his deranged head out of him. It made Karney feel dirty, and he wanted no part of it.<br><br>Red pulled Pope off the wall and spat a stream of abuse into the man's face, then, when he failed to get an adequate response, threw him back against the tunnel a second time, more forcibly than the first, following through by taking the breathless man by both lapels and shaking him until he rattled. Pope threw a panicky glance up and down the track. A railway had once run along this route through Highgate and Finsbury Park. The track was long gone, however, and the site was public parkland, popular with early morning joggers and late-evening lovers. Now, in the middle of a clammy afternoon, the track was deserted in both directions.<br><br>"Hey," said Catso, "don't break his bottles."<br><br>"Right," said Brendan, "we should dig out the drink before we break his head."<br><br>At the mention of being robbed of his liquor Pope began to struggle, but his thrashing only served to enrage his captor. Red was in a dirty mood. The day, like most days this Indian summer, had been sticky and dull. Only the dog-end of a wasted season to endure; nothing to do, and no money to spend. Some entertainment had been called for, and it had fallen to Red as lion, and Pope as Christian, to supply it.<br><br>"You'll get hurt if you struggle," Red advised the man, "we only want to see what you've got in your pockets."<br><br>"None of your business," Pope retorted, and for a moment he spoke as a man who had once been used to being obeyed. The outburst made Karney turn from the gnats and gaze at Pope's emaciated face. Nameless degeneracies had drained it of dignity or vigor, but something remained there, glimmering beneath the dirt. What had the man been, Karney wondered? A banker perhaps? A judge, now lost to the law forever?<br><br>Catso had now stepped into the fray to search Pope's clothes, while Red held his prisoner against the tunnel wall by the throat. Pope fought off Catso's unwelcome attentions as best he could, his arms flailing like windmills, his eyes getting progressively wilder. Don't fight, Karney willed him, it'll be worse for you if you do. But the old man seemed to be on the verge of panic. He was letting out small grunts of protest that were more animal than human.<br><br>"Somebody hold his arms," Catso said, ducking beneath Pope's attack. Brendan grabbed hold of Pope's wrists and wrenched the man's arms up above his head to facilitate an easier search. Even now, with any hope of release dashed, Pope continued to squirm. He managed to land a solid kick to Red's left shin, for which he received a blow in return. Blood broke from his nose and ran down into his mouth. There was more color where that came from, Karney knew. He'd seen pictures aplenty of spilled people -- bright, gleaming coils of guts; yellow fat and purple lungs -- all that brilliance was locked up in the gray sack of Pope's body. Why such a thought should occur to him Karney wasn't certain. It distressed him, and he tried to turn his attention back to the gnats, but Pope demanded his attention, loosing a cry of anguish as Catso ripped open one of his several waistcoats to get to the lower layers.<br><br><i>"Bastards!"</i> Pope screeched, not seeming to care that his insults would inevitably earn him further blows. "Take your shitting hands off me or I'll have you <i>dead</i>. All of you!" Red's fist brought an end to the threats, and blood came running after blood. Pope spat it back at his tormentor. "Don't tempt me," Pope said, his voice dropping to a murmur. "I warn you..."<br><br>"You smell like a dead dog," Brendan said. "Is that what you are: a dead dog?"<br><br>Pope didn't grant him a reply. His eyes were on Catso, who was systematically emptying the coat and waistcoat pockets and tossing a pathetic collection of keepsakes into the dust on the tunnel floor.<br><br>"Karney," Red snapped, "look through the stuff, will you? See if there's anything worth having."<br><br>Karney stared at the plastic trinkets and the soiled ribbons, at the tattered sheets of paper (was the man a poet?) and the wine-bottle corks. "It's all trash," he said.<br><br>"Look anyway," Red instructed. "Could be money wrapped in that stuff." Karney made no move to comply. "<i>Look,</i> damn you."<br><br>Reluctantly, Karney went down on his haunches and proceeded to sift through the mound of rubbish Catso was still depositing in the dirt. He could see at a glance that there was nothing of value there, though perhaps some of the items -- the battered photographs, the all but indecipherable notes -- might offer some clue to the man Pope had been before drink and incipient lunacy had driven the memories away. Curious as he was, Karney wished to respect Pope's privacy. It was all the man had left.<br><br>"There's nothing here," he announced after a cursory examination. But Catso hadn't finished his search. The deeper he dug the more layers of filthy clothing presented themselves to his eager hands. Pope had more pockets than a master magician.<br><br>Karney glanced up from the forlorn heap of belongings and found, to his discomfort, that Pope's eyes were on him. The old man, exhausted and beaten, had given up his protests. He looked pitiful. Karney opened his hands to signify that he had taken nothing from the heap. Pope, by way of reply, offered a tiny nod.<br><br>"Got it!" Catso yelled triumphantly. "Got the fucker!" and pulled a bottle of vodka from one of the pockets. Pope was either too feeble to notice that his alcohol supply had been snatched or too tired to care. Whichever way, he made no sound of complaint as the liquor was stolen from him.<br><br>"Any more?" Brendan wanted to know. He'd begun to giggle, a high-pitched laugh that signaled his escalating excitement. "Maybe the dog's got more where that came from," he said, letting Pope's hands fall and pushing Catso aside. The latter made no objection to the treatment. He had his bottle and was satisfied. He smashed off the neck to avoid contamination and began to drink, squatting in the dirt. Red relinquished his grip on Pope now that Brendan had taken charge. He was clearly bored with the game. Brendan, on the other hand, was just beginning to get a taste for it.<br><br>Red walked over to Karney and turned over the pile of Pope's belongings with the toe of his boot.<br><br>"Fucking wash-out," he stated, without feeling.<br><br>"Yeah," Karney said, hoping that Red's disaffection would signal an end to the old man's humiliation. But Red had thrown the bone to Brendan, and he knew better than to try and snatch it back. Karney had seen Brendan's capacity for violence before and he had no desire to watch the man at work again. Sighing, he stood up and turned his back on Brendan's activities. The echoes off the tunnel's wall were all too eloquent however, a mingling of punches and breathless obscenities. On past evidence nothing would stop Brendan until his fury was spent. Anyone foolish enough to interrupt him would find themselves victims in their turn.<br><br>Red had sauntered across to the far side of the tunnel, lit a cigarette, and was watching the punishment meted out with casual interest. Karney glanced around at Catso. He had descended from squatting to sitting in the dirt, the bottle of vodka between his outstretched legs. He was grinning to himself, deaf to the drool of pleas falling from Pope's broken mouth.<br><br>Karney felt sick to his stomach. More to divert his attention from the beating than out of genuine interest, he returned to the junk filched from Pope's pockets and turned it over, picking up one of the photographs to examine. It was of a child, though it was impossible to make any guess as to family resemblance. Pope's face was now barely recognizable; one eye had already begun to close as the bruise around it swelled. Karney tossed the photograph back with the rest of the mementos. As he did so he caught sight of a length of knotted cord which he had previously passed over. He glanced back up at Pope. The puffed eye was closed, the other seemed sightless. Satisfied that he wasn't being watched, Karney pulled the string from where it lay, coiled like a snake in its nest, among the trash. Knots fascinated him and always had. Though he had never possessed skill with academic puzzles (mathematics was a mystery to him; the intricacies of language the same) he had always had a taste for more tangible riddles. Given a knot, a jigsaw or a railway timetable, he was happily lost to himself for hours. The interest went back to his childhood, which had been solitary. With neither father nor siblings to engage his attention what better companion than a puzzle?<br><br>He turned the string over and over, examining the three knots set at inch intervals in the middle of its length. They were large and asymmetrical and seemed to serve no discernible purpose except, perhaps, to infatuate minds like his own. How else to explain their cunning construction except that the knotter had been at pains to create a problem that was well nigh insoluble? He let his fingers play over the surfaces of the knots, instinctively seeking some latitude, but they had been so brilliantly contrived that no needle, however fine, could have been pushed between the intersected strands. The challenge they presented was too appealing to ignore. Again he glanced up at the old man. Brendan had apparently tired of his labors. As Karney looked on he threw the old man against the tunnel wall and let the body sink to the ground. Once there, he let it lie. An unmistakable sewer stench rose from it.<br><br>"That was good," Brendan pronounced like a man who had stepped from an invigorating shower. The exercise had raised a sheen of sweat on his ruddy features; he was smiling from ear to ear. "Give me some of that vodka, Catso."<br><br>"All gone," Catso slurred, upending the bottle. "Wasn't more than a throatful in it."<br><br>"You're a lying shit," Brendan told him, still grinning.<br><br>"What if I am?" Catso replied, and tossed the empty bottle away. It smashed. "Help me up," he requested of Brendan. The latter, his great good humor intact, helped Catso to his feet. Red had already started to walk out of the tunnel; the others followed.<br><br>"Hey Karney," Catso said over his shoulder, "you coming?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"You want to kiss the dog better?" Brendan suggested. Catso was almost sick with laughter at the remark. Karney made no answer. He stood up, his eyes glued to the inert figure slumped on the tunnel floor, watching for a flicker of consciousness. There was none that he could see. He glanced after the others. All three had their backs to him as they made their way down the track. Swiftly, Karney pocketed the knots. The theft took moments only. Once the cord was safely out of sight he felt a surge of triumph which was out of all proportion to the goods he'd gained. He was already anticipating the hours of amusement the knots would furnish. Time when he could forget himself, and his emptiness; forget the sterile summer and the loveless winter ahead; forget too the old man lying in his own waste yards from where he stood.<br><br>"Karney!" Catso called.<br><br>Karney turned his back on Pope and began to walk away from the body and the attendant litter of belongings. A few paces from the edge of the tunnel the old man behind him began to mutter in his delirium. The words were incomprehensible. But by some acoustic trick, the walls of the tunnel multiplied the sound. Pope's voice was thrown back and forth and back again, filling the tunnel with whispers.<br><br>It wasn't until much later that night, when he was sitting alone in his bedroom with his mother weeping in her sleep next door, that Karney had the opportunity to study the knots at leisure. He had said nothing to Red or the others about his stealing the cord. The theft was so minor they would have mocked him for mentioning it. And besides, the knots offered him a personal challenge, one which he would face -- and conceivably fail -- in private.<br><br>After some debate with himself he elected the knot he would first attempt and began to work at it. Almost immediately he lost all sense of time passing; the problem engrossed him utterly. Hours of blissful frustration passed unnoticed as he analyzed the tangle, looking for some clue as to a hidden system in the knotting. He could find none. The configurations, if they <i>had</i> some rationale, were beyond him. All he could hope to do was tackle the problem by trial and error. Dawn was threatening to bring the world to light again when he finally relinquished the cord to snatch a few hours of sleep, and in a night's work he had merely managed to loosen a tiny fraction of the knot.<br><br>Over the next four days the problem became an <i>id�e fixe,</i> a hermetic obsession to which he would return at any available opportunity, picking at the knot with fingers that were increasingly numb with use. The puzzle enthralled him as little in his adult life ever had. Working at the knot he was deaf and blind to the outside world. Sitting in his lamp-lit room by night, or in the park by day, he could almost feel himself drawn into its snarled heart, his consciousness focused so minutely it could go where light could not. But despite his persistence, the unraveling proved a slow business. Unlike most knots he had encountered, whi...</p><h2>Stolen (Women of the Otherworld)</h2><p>The only living female werewolf, thirty-year-old Elena Michaels takes on a mission to confront Internet billionaire Tyrone Winsloe, who has been capturing Elena&#39;s fellow paranormal brethren, conducting experiments on them, and hunting them to their deaths in a live video game.

He also wrote some other very cogent books, including &#34;The Pursuit of Loneliness&#34; and &#34;Wealth Addiction,&#34; but this is his masterpiece. It is an utterly brilliant book, but one that will be rejected out of hand by those who still believe in the myth of progress. One short excerpt will give you the idea: &#34;The kind of growth Western culture has experienced over the past three hundred years would be considered a sign of gross malfunction in any other context. Healthy growth is paced differently - it does not absorb or destroy everything living around it. It is cancerous cells that grow and reproduce rapidly in total disregard of their connection with surrounding cells. From this viewpoint technology would have to be regarded as a cancer on human culture, Western culture as a cancer on the human species, and the human species as a cancer on terrestrial life - a cancer that may in the end be treated by radiation and radical surgery at the same time.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>My Very First Winnie the Pooh Growing Up Stories (Disney Storybook Collections)</h2><p>A collection of Pooh stories is designed to teach preschoolers basic concepts such as the seasons and to lessen fears about &#34;firsts&#34; such as going to the doctor or the first day of school.</p><p></p><h2>Greece in Spectacular Cross-section</h2><p>Following on from his internationally bestselling books on Rome and Egypt, master illustrator Stephen Biesty brings his magic touch to the cradle of civilization - classical Greece.<br><br>The year is 436 BCE - Olympic year - and 11-year-old Neleus is about to embark on the journey of a lifetime.

A decade ago, Gallagher was one of the rediscoverers of the legendary ivory-billed woodpecker, which most scientists believed had been extinct for more than half a century&#x2014;an event that caused an international stir. Now, in <i>Imperial Dreams, </i>Gallagher once again hits the trail, journeying deep into Mexico&#x2019;s savagely beautiful Sierra Madre Occidental, home to rich wildlife, as well as to Mexican drug cartels, in a perilous quest to locate the most elusive bird in the world&#x2014;the imperial woodpecker, a giant among its clan. <br><br>The imperial woodpecker&#x2019;s trumpetlike calls and distinctive hammering on massive pines once echoed through the high forests. Two feet tall, with deep black plumage, a brilliant snow-white shield on its back, and a crimson crest, the imperial woodpecker had largely disappeared fifty years ago, though reports persist of the bird still flying through remote mountain stands. In an attempt to find and protect the imperial woodpecker in its last habitat, Gallagher is guided by a map of sightings of this natural treasure of the Sierra Madre, bestowed on him by a friend on his deathbed. Charged with continuing the quest of a line of distinguished naturalists, including the great Aldo Leopold, Gallagher treks through this mysterious, historically untamed and untamable territory. Here, where an ancient petroglyph of the imperial can still be found, Geronimo led Apaches in their last stand, William Randolph Hearst held a storied million-acre ranch, and Pancho Villa once roamed, today ruthless drug lords terrorize residents and steal and strip the land. <br><br>Gallagher&#x2019;s passionate quest takes a harrowing turn as he encounters armed drug traffickers, burning houses, and fleeing villagers. His mission becomes a life-and-death drama that will keep armchair adventurers enthralled as he chases truth in the most dangerous of habitats.</p><p><b>Tim Gallagher </b>is an author, wildlife photographer, and magazine editor, currently editor-in-chief of <i>Living Bird</i>, the magazine of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.

It deals with his return to his native island of Sri Lanka, also called Ceylon, in the late 1970s. It also deals with his family. Much of the focus falls on his father Mervyn Ondaatje and his scandalous drunken antics. Michael&#39;s grandmother Lalla is another family member that is explored in detail. Many themes are explored in the lives of his family, particularly luxurious frivolity (especially in the 1920s) and dipsomania. The book often seems to blur the lines of fiction and history by offering diverse accounts of certain incidents and re tellings of isolated events about which the author couldn&#39;t logically know so many intimate details. It is ultimately about a man&#39;s quest to reconcile himself with the father he scarcely knew and come to terms with the loss of not knowing that man. This narrative which locates the writer and his journey towards a father, who is no longer alive, but constantly present in the narrative, is also a story of individual identity and its intersections with a larger identity of a minority community in the country. Some important themes include: memory (its reliability, importance, and what makes it valuable), assumptions about others, the importance of family, and societal expectations. Another significant extension of the theme of memory is the blurred line between memory and history. History becomes anecdote, the past that is remembered: recollected and recounted, a negotiation with memory and its unreliability. This book also contains many motifs including maps, nature and money. Motifs also include the sensorial dynamics of memory: sounds, smells and colours.</p><p>2 cassettes / 3 hours<br>Read by Michael Ondaatje<br><br>"Michael Ondaatje is here at his agile and evocative best . . .

Discover how and why Hal received the power ring that changed his life forever. Uncover the mystery of the death of Jordan's predecessor, Abin Sur. Find out why Jordan's teacher and mentor, Sinestro, became obsessed with the prophecy of the apocalyptic end of the universe "the Blackest Night".<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><strong>Ryan Reynolds on <em>Green Lantern: Secret Origin</em></strong> <p>I was never an expert on Hal Jordan. I&#x2019;d always known the basic gist of the character: I knew he wore a lot of green. Had a ring possessed of infinite power bestowed upon him by a dying alien. And I knew he&#x2019;s survived many successors and wildly diverse iterations over an astonishing multi-decade run. If you like sports analogies, he&#x2019;s the New York Yankees. Lately though, I&#x2019;ve gotten to know the guy pretty damn well. Like Hal Jordan, I too was given the gift of a ring. Mine was more symbolic in its power but no less auspicious. I was asked to put that ring on and bring Hal Jordan to life in a whole new form: Film. Not a job I take lightly.</p> <p>About a year and a half ago, I first sat down with Martin Campbell, Donald DeLine, and a man whom I consider responsible for the resurgent interest in Green Lantern, Geoff Johns. They were all eager to build a big screen superhero who would both live up to his lengthy legacy, yet simultaneously find a foothold with a whole new audience--young and old alike. Hal Jordan was about to become a living, breathing person. And I was going to be the guy to do it. No pressure...</p> <p>True fans of Hal Jordan know the caliber of hero we&#x2019;re talking about. From the moment I came aboard, I saw the challenge and opportunity in creating a classic yet modern day hero who can throw a punch, tell a joke, and kiss the girl. I saw the guy as a cross between Chuck Yeager and Han Solo. The Green Lantern saga is so limitless in its scope, I&#x2019;m sure it was a relief for the writers to know it was going to be an origin story of sorts. They need look no further than the starting point.</p> <p><em>Green Lantern</em> encompasses a seemingly limitless supply of adventure: fighter jets, space travel, action, aliens, betrayal, humor, tragedy, heroes, villains, and even a rather complicated little love story. These are just a few ingredients, which have been a part of this epic for over 50 years.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a great time to be a superhero fan. Technology is such that bringing Green Lantern to life properly is finally possible. Creating energy constructs based upon infinite will and pure imagination can vividly appear before our very eyes. This technological leap also happened to coincide with a time period in which the world is fascinated by big screen comic book adaptations.</p> <p>Preparing to get Hal up and running in living color was helped greatly by this book, <em>Secret Origin</em>, illustrated beautifully by Ivan Reis, who I had the pleasure of meeting on the set in New Orleans. This book basically gave me the introduction I was looking for in order to begin the incredible ascent to Oa. I hope you like it.</p> <p><em>--Ryan Reynolds</em></p>Geoff Johns, a Detroit native, brings a Hollywood sense of story-telling to comics. After working as an assistant to Richard Donner (director of Lethal Weapon, Superman and many other great films), Geoff has brought his considerable writing talent to comics. For DC he has written Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.S., The Flash, Green Lantern and the enormously popular JSA with David Goyer and helped revitalize Hawkman with James Robinson.</p><h2>Alger Hiss&#39;s Looking-Glass Wars: The Covert Life of a Soviet Spy</h2><p>For decades, a great number of Americans saw Alger Hiss as an innocent victim of McCarthyism--a distinguished diplomat railroaded by an ambitious Richard Nixon. And even as the case against Hiss grew over time, his dignified demeanor helped create an aura of innocence that outshone the facts in many minds. <br> Now G. Edward White deftly draws together the countless details of Hiss's life--from his upper middle-class childhood in Baltimore and his brilliant success at Harvard to his later career as a self-made martyr to McCarthyism--to paint a fascinating portrait of a man whose life was devoted to perpetuating a lie. White catalogs the evidence that proved Hiss's guilt, from Whittaker Chambers's famous testimony, to copies of State Department documents typed on Hiss's typewriter, to Allen Weinstein's groundbreaking investigation in the 1970s. The author then explores the central conundrums of Hiss's life: Why did this talented lawyer become a Communist and a Soviet spy? Why did he devote so much of his life to an extensive public campaign to deny his espionage? And how, without producing any new evidence, did he convince many people that he was innocent? White offers a compelling analysis of Hiss's behavior in the face of growing evidence of his guilt, revealing how this behavior fit into an ongoing pattern of denial and duplicity in his life.<br> The story of Alger Hiss is in part a reflection of Cold War America--a time of ideological passions, partisan battles, and secret lives. It is also a story that transcends a particular historical era--a story about individuals who choose to engage in espionage for foreign powers and the secret worlds they choose to conceal. In White's skilled hands, the life of Alger Hiss comes to illuminate both of those themes.</p><p><br><strong>G. Edward White</strong> is David and Mary Harrison Distinguished Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. His books include <em>Oliver Wendell Holmes: Sage of the Supreme Court</em> and several other works of biography and law. His father-in-law, John F. Davis, served as Alger Hiss's counsel in a 1948 hearing of the House Un-American Activities Committee.<br><br>"With his portrait of the man himself--as well as supporters, for whom almost no evidence was convincing--Mr. White has written the best book ever about Alger Hiss." -- Michael J. Ybarra, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"An extraordinary book, packed with information and fresh insights. Part detective story, part cultural history, part psychodrama--I couldn't put it down."--Cass Sunstein, author of <em>Republic.Com</em><p></p><br>"What White accomplishes in this innovative and brilliant new book is not yet another attempt to show Hiss's guilt, but rather an examination of how Hiss was both a gifted Soviet agent and 'a successful publicizer of his innocence,' able to convince so many people.... It is the achievement of G. Edward White to have provided the final unmasking of Alger Hiss, and, one hopes, put an end once and for all to the campaign waged on the traitor's behalf."--Ronald Radosh, <em>National Review</em><p></p><br>"If you accept Hiss's guilt, as most historians now do, you will profit from G. Edward White's supplementary speculations about why, after prison, that serene and charming man sacrificed his marriage, exploited a son's love and abused the trust of fervent supporters to wage a 42-year struggle for a vindication that could never be honestly gained."--Max Frankel, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"In this inclusive, impressive, deeply pondered and finely spun study, G. Edward White has provided a definitive analysis of the Hiss case. <em>Alger Hiss's Looking-Glass Wars</em> should provide a welcome close to the controversy over this historic imbroglio."--<em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"An intriguing portrait of an enigmatic man who stood center stage during the most electrifying moments of the Cold War."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"A significant contribution to a subject that continues to fascinate Americans.... White presents an Alger Hiss with some depth and significance, a consummate spy who was able to maintain the facade of innocence for nearly half of his life."--<em>New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"With its incisive analysis and readability, this is a worthwhile addition to the vast Hiss literature."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Should be the final and definitive history of the famous case. Brilliantly written and massively researched, White's deeply understanding analysis of Hiss's obsessive, life-long and at times almost successful efforts to repudiate the charge of treason should convince all but those to whom his innocence has become a matter of dogma."--Louis Auchincloss<p></p><br>"An extremely valuable and much needed contribution to the history of the Hiss-Chambers Case. G. Edward White provides a nuanced biographical study of how Hiss dealt with various challenges in his life and how his steadfast insistence on his innocence despite all of the damning evidence fits into that pattern. White combines this psychological study with a discerning analysis of the evidence available at the time of the trial as well as that coming to light subsequently along with an insightful review of the literature on the case. White's Alger Hiss's Looking Glass Wars bids to join Weinstein's <em>Perjury</em> and Tanenhaus's <em>Whittaker Chambers</em> as one of the indispensable books on the Hiss-Chambers Case." --John Earl Haynes, co-author of <em>In Denial: Historians, Communism, and Espionage</em> and <em>Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America</em><p></p><br>"A great read, a real page-turner. This is the first of the books about Alger Hiss fully to accept that he was a Soviet spy. White moves on to ask the fascinating question--if Hiss was guilty of everything he was charged with (and more), why did he spend his post-prison decades steadfastly proclaiming his innocence? The answer seems to be that this was how Hiss had dealt with all the major crises of his earlier life. And this book explains what they were in lucid and compelling prose." --Stanley N. Katz, Director, Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University<p></p><br></p><h2>Everything Goes: 123 Beep Beep Beep!: A Counting Book</h2><p><p>Vroom!</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>Count from 1 to 10 with fire trucks, motorcycles, race cars, and more! </p></p><p><p>Everything Goes is a series of books written and illustrated by Brian Biggs.

E. James Dixon dispels the stereotype of big-game hunters following mammoths across the Bering Land Bridge and paints a vivid picture of marine mammal hunters, fishers, and general foragers colonizing the New World. Applying contemporary scientific methods and drawing on new archeological discoveries, he advances evidence indicating that humans first reached the Americas using water craft along the deglaciated Northwest Coast about 13,500 years ago, some 2,000 years before the first Clovis hunters. Dixon's rigorous evaluation of the oldest North American archeological sites and human remains offers well-reasoned hypotheses about the physical characteristics, lives, and relationships of the First Americans. His crisply written analysis of scientific exploration is essential reading for scholars, students, and general readers.</p></p><p>This revolutionary synthesis dispels the stereotype of big game hunters following mammoths across the Bering Land Bridge, while painting a vivid picture of marine mammal hunters, fishers, and general foragers colonizing the New World.E.

Three long poems allow him to explore profoundly the human condition, by examining language and love, race and favor, faith and dogma, war and ruin. In the lyrical "This Is My Name " and "Introduction to the History of the Petty Kings, " Adonis ponders Arab defeat and defeatism. In "A Grave for New York, " he focuses on Vietnam-era America. Originally published in 1970 to widespread acclaim, the collection has been reprinted often but has never before appeared in English. Enhanced by Shawkat M.

The journal was founded in order to promote a new kind of history&#x2014;the substitution of a problem-oriented analytical history for a traditional narrative of events, and the history of the whole range of human activities in place of a mainly political history.<br><br>This critical text describes, analyzes, and evaluates the acheivements of the Annales School, combining chronological and thematic approaches. The author distinguishes three generations in the history of the Annales movement. In the first phase, from the 1920's to 1945, the movement was small, radical, and substantive, fighting a guerrilla action against traditional political history and the history of events. Its leaders, and the founders of Annales, were Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch. After the Second World War, the movement's rebels took over the historical establishment. During this second phase, which lasted untill about 1968, the movement was most nearly a school, with distinctive concepts and mehods, and was presided over by the towering figure of Fernand Braudel. The third phase of the movement was marked by fragmentation.</p><p>Peter Burke is Professor Emeritus of Cultural History at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge.No one has had a greater collective impact on modern historiography than the historians of the Annales school, and no one has appraised their aims and achievements with more sympathetic insight than Peter Burke. His concise, inclusive, and authoritative survey of the transformations they brought about is itself a powerful incentive to think reflectively about the idea of history. Stuart Clark, University of Swansea [and editor of The Annales School: Critical Assessments, 1999.] Eminent historian of modern France, Peter Burke is also a great connoisseur of French historians, and especially of the Annales School. This new and expanded edition of The French Historical Revolution brings out the contribution of a 4th generation of the Annales open to the diversity of the world, its hybridity and cultural encounters through the work of its most original and productive representatives, such as Serge Gruzinski, Lucette Valensi and Nathan Wachtel.

Copyright � 2004 by Douglas Porch. To be published in May, 2004 by Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux. All rights reserved.<br><b>PREFACE</b><br><br>This book counts several points of origin. The first is a lifelong fascination for the Mediterranean that springs from its rich history, the mosaic of peoples who live along its coasts, and the stunning beauty of its land and seascapes. A second motivating factor has been my students at the Naval Postgraduate School, many of whom serve with the U.S. Mediterranean fleet and in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia or Kosovo, or who are natives of Mediterranean nations. They challenge one to understand the importance of the Mediterranean as a maritime highway, a geographic link between and among continents and oceans.<br><br>The "Joint and Combined" emphasis of U.S. military education encourages the study and practice of the interaction between air, sea, and land power in a multifaceted operational environment. While the combination of these three forms of warfare are conditions for victory in all theaters, their efficient interaction was especially vital in the Mediterranean theater in World War II. This requires that one consider the Mediterranean theater as a geographic and strategic whole, rather than as a sequence of discrete campaigns. The Mediterranean was more than the sum of its parts. Those who fought there had to engage over the sweep of a theater that offers a particularly complex series of operational as well as strategic challenges. The extreme variations in geography, not to mention forms of warfare, especially from 1943 when Italy signed an armistice and insurgency warfare kicked in on the northern shore of the Mediterranean, put pressure on generals and admirals constantly to reconfigure and adapt their armies, navies, and air forces to new conditions. As in the Pacific, victory or defeat in World War II Mediterranean campaigns came down to who fought more efficiently in a three-dimensional setting. But the land component in the Mediterranean was far larger than in the island-hopping Pacific campaigns. A military force that mastered one or even two forms of warfare, but was deficient in a third, found itself at a severe disadvantage. Initially the Axis united German proficiency in land and air warfare with Italian sea power to command the "central position" in the Mediterranean. This allowed Rommel to run circles around the British in the Western Desert. But Axis air and naval power proved to be wasting assets. And while the Wehrmacht remained formidable right up to the last days of the war, years of Mediterranean fighting had shorn it of offensive capability, reducing it to desperate defensive campaigns in the mountains of Italy and the forests of the Balkans.<br><br>Finally, victory was determined not only by how one fought, but <i>where</i> one fought. War is never conducted in a political vacuum, but is, as Clausewitz reminds us, "politics by other means." In the politically complex, even volatile Mediterranean world, this famous dictum could almost be stood on its head. German and "Anglo-Saxon" generals particularly detested fighting in the Mediterranean, where every strategic decision, every coalition, every invasion proposal was prickly with political consequence. The British commander in the Middle East, General Archibald Wavell, resisted fighting in politically fractured Greece, Syria, and Iraq. French and Italian politics meant sleepless nights for Allied commanders right up to war' end. Meanwhile, it could be said that the Axis failed to exploit its political opportunities in the Arab world and seriously mismanaged the political dimensions of its occupation of the Balkan Peninsula and Greece, with significant military consequences.<br><br>This book, therefore, is a work of synthesis, one that attempts to meld the histories of the individual campaigns in North Africa, Greece and Crete, the Horn of Africa, Syria and Iraq, Tunisia, and Sicily and Italy, and the histories of the air and sea wars and the insurgencies fought out on, above, and around the seas. But this work aspires to be more than a litany of battles. I have examined the interrelationship of these campaigns in the context of a Mediterranean theater and a Mediterranean strategy to better assess the importance of the Mediterranean in its relationship to the larger war. Historians have not, on the whole, been kind to the Allied Mediterranean effort. From its inception, the Mediterranean was an "encounter" theater, a place where Italian and British interests intersected. Churchill opted to fight there to protect the corridor to the British empire, to demonstrate that London meant to fight to the knife against the Axis, to emphasize his distance from Chamberlain's failed appeasement policies, to attract U.S. support, and possibly to redeem a Mediterranean strategy that had foundered at Gallipoli in World War I. As a consequence, Hitler was forced to intervene to rescue Mussolini. American strategy was grafted onto the original British investment at Roosevelt's insistence, over the protests of his secretary of war and his chief of staff, who argued that intervention in the Mediterranean attacked no German center of gravity, and therefore constituted a wasteful diversion of American assets for the benefit of the "British empire machine."<br><br>The consequence of this Allied stumble into a poorly thought-out and "opportunistic" Mediterranean strategy was a dreadful slogging match in a theater in which the British and subsequently the Americans were outgeneraled and outfought around the shores of a sea of trifling strategic importance. British historian John Ellis complained that "the Mediterranean is consistently over-emphasized in most English studies of the war . . . the whole campaign barely merits an extended footnote." While the Mediterranean did constitute a strategic diversion, "the overall impression, indeed, is of a remarkable lack of direction in Mediterranean planning, with key decisions taken off the cuff, simply because no one, least of all on the American side, could think of anything better to do."1 Corelli Barnett called the Allied Mediterranean strategy a "cul-de-sac . . . mere byplay in the conclusion of a war that had been won in mass battles on the Eastern and Western Fronts."2 The Allies paid a heavy price for their opportunism because, by September 1943, their Mediterranean commitments had been funneled into the blind alley of the Italian Peninsula. This led to the foreseeable consequence, once preparations for the invasion of Northwestern Europe got under way, of the two regions' being treated as rival, rather than complementary, theaters. David Kennedy has called the Italian campaign "a slogan not a strategy," and condemned that battleground as "a grinding war of attrition whose costs were justified by no defensible military or political purpose."3 Others, while offering a more balanced assessment of the Italian campaign, nevertheless consider the Mediterranean portion of Allied grand strategy to have been a "failure" because, much as in World War I, the Mediterranean competed with, rather than complemented, the main Western Front.4 British historian John Keegan compares Italy to Wellington's campaign against Napoleonic forces in Spain, one in which the soldiers' "sense of purpose and stoutness of heart" are all the more to be admired "because of the campaign's marginality." "Their war was not a crusade," he writes, "but, in almost every respect, an old-fashioned one of strategic diversion on the maritime flank of a continental enemy, the 'Peninsular War' of 1939-45."5<br><br>This work argues that while the Mediterranean was not the decisive theater of the war, it was the <i>pivotal</i> theater, a requirement for Allied success. None of the Mediterranean theater's staunchest advocates at the time&#x2014;Churchill, Harold Alexander, nor Mark Clark&#x2014;ever argued that the Mediterranean should or could replace the Eastern Front or Northwestern Europe in importance. However, they did believe that the Mediterranean was a vital prelude to the invasion of Northwestern Europe, and that it played a significant role in the defeat of the Axis. This book seeks to explain how significant that contribution actually was to Allied victory. In the process, it assesses the relationship of the peripheral Mediterranean theater with the main Eastern and Western Fronts. My argument is that it was impossible for the Western Allies to transition successfully from Dunkirk to Operation Overlord without passing through the Mediterranean. That theater was critical in forging the Anglo-American alliance, in permitting Allied armies to acquire fighting skills, audition leaders and staffs, and evolve the technical, operational, tactical, and intelligence systems required to invade Normandy successfully in June 1944. Overlord was rehearsed in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. By 6 June 1944, the Mediterranean had worn down and ultimately dismembered the Axis. The "Peninsular War of 1939-45" became Hitler's hematoma, much as its "old-fashioned" 1808-14 counterpart had created an ulcer for Napoleon over a century earlier. It bought time for Roosevelt to build up American forces so that he could impose Washington's primacy in the Western Alliance, and therefore to shape postwar Europe according to U.S., rather than British or European, priorities.<br><br>To factor the Mediterranean out of World War II is to imagine a disaster of epic proportions, and a military outcome in the European theater far different from an unconditional surrender of Germany. Some who fault the Mediterranean strategy, like American historian Robert Love, blame it for delaying the invasion of Northwestern Europe, which, had it been carried out in 1943, would have brought an earlier end to the Reich and preempted Stalin's land grab in Eastern Europe. Love blames a combination of Churchill's imperial ambitions and Roosevelt's "vacillation" for "a wasteful, peripheral strategy in the Mediterranean" that allowed the Russians to overrun Eastern Europe and gave the...</p><h2>Romancing with Life: An Autobiography</h2><p>With the death of Dev Anand in December 2011, Bollywood lost its most passionate, most charismatic romantic hero. <br><br> In Romancing with Life, Dev Anand tells his remarkable life story no less dramatic and gripping than any of his films as only he could.

This book presents an astonishing range of findings--more than 200 works of art in jade, stone, ivory, bone, pottery, bronze, lacquer, bamboo, gold, and silver from the period 5000 B.C. to 900 A.D.--that show how culture flowered not only in the Yellow River Valley but throughout ancient China. <p>The book is 584 pages with 48 B&amp;W + 372 color illustrations and the book size is 9 5/8 x 12 1/8.</p></p><p>Fifty years of scientific archaeology in the People's Republic of China (PRC) have redefined early Chinese culture. This handsome volume surveys some of the most spectacular recent finds and their role in reshaping the history of civilization in ancient China. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., teamed up with Kansas City's Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art to organize a second extravaganza of unburied treasures, emphasizing discoveries made since their last show in 1974. The more than 175 objects from four historical periods and in numerous media represent important early sites and a diversity of cultures located outside the central Yellow River area--most notably in the south and southwest regions, like the state of Chu. The range is vast, from roughly painted pots about 6,000 years old to lovely clay and marble figures modeling the courtly fashions of 1,000 years ago. The excellent photographs and short texts on individual objects and their excavation sites describe their artistic and historical importance and prompt readers to savor individual artifacts over broad sweeps of history. Linger over a unique pottery basin painted with diagonal lozenges; an over-life-size bronze figure and related heads with strikingly geometrical features; various fantastic creatures in bronze and jade; lacquer bowls and silk garment fragments that have unbelievably survived the centuries; and polychromed Buddhist deities that reveal details like blue mustaches and eyebrows. <p> The exhibition runs in Washington, D.C., then Houston, Texas, and San Francisco, California, through September 2000. <i>--Alex Lawrence</i></p>This catalog documents a landmark exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; the Nelson-Arkins Museum of Art, Kansas City; and the People's Republic of China. The exhibition will also travel to Houston and San Francisco. It is a sequel to the show of archaeological finds from China displayed at the National Gallery of Art in 1974. The book's images display with great clarity the most important archaeological discoveries in the People's Republic of China excavated since the late 1970s. Representing achievements over a 6000-year time span (5000 B.C.E. to 1000 C.E.) and a wide geographical range, it features more than 200 artifacts of the highest artistic and historical value--including sculpture, ritual objects, furniture, textiles, and decorative objects. An introductory essay traces the development of Chinese archaeology, pointing out an altered view on formation and development of Chinese civilization. As one of the most significant publications on the subject in the English language during the past few decades, this book truly opens a window on the themes and motifs of the past 60 centuries of Chinese civilization. It is essential for public as well as academic libraries.<br><i>-Lucia S.

They contain the magical cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent, the Kazakh steppes, the deserts of Karakum and the Pamir mountains. North of Iran and west of China, east of the Caspian Sea, this is an enormous land, as big as Western Europe, heart of the great Mongol Empire of Tamerlane, route of the silk roads and scene of Stalin&#39;s most devilish deportations.</p><p>West of China, south of Russia, hemmed in by mountains, steppe, and desert, lie the five Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. Cut loose from Moscow in the early '90s, the five "Stans" (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan) discover that their newly found freedom plays tug-o-war with despair and a nostalgia for the certainties of the Soviet past. It's during this time that author Colin Thubron travels the width of central Asia, asking questions about the past, present, and future. Not content to simply bounce from place to place, Thubron travels from person to person, uncovering their many vibrant stories and developing a deep understanding of the area's lesser-known history. Kyrgyz and Uzbeks debate the place of Islam. Koreans and Germans, descendants from forced migrants, wonder if they know enough of their ethnic tongue to return to their homelands. Russians find themselves left behind, disbelieving, as the tide of Russian power recedes toward Moscow. <p> Central Asia was mostly off limits to foreigners during the Soviet years, and while officials are still uncertain about how to deal with a backpack-wearing solo traveler, the locals Thubron meets are not. Thubron finds the heart of Asia in the hearts of its people, swimming in a sea of tea, vodka, and hospitality. From the oldest-known Quran to a deserted Soviet naval base on the shores of a high mountain lake 1,500 miles from the ocean (used to test torpedoes far from spying eyes), Thubron's writing echoes the melancholy emptiness of the wide spaces he passes through. <i> The Lost Heart of Asia</i> is a rare meeting of a marvelous writer and a mysterious land. <i>--Ken Peavler</i></p>A travel book on the newly-emergent countries of central Asia which contain the magical cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, the Kazakh Steppes, the deserts of Karakum and the Pamir Mountains.</p><h2>Rainbow&#39;s End: An Explosive Put-in-Bay Thriller with Unexpected Twists</h2><p>This action-packed myster novel was a runner up as the top fiction novel in the Great Lakes Book Award contest in 2003 which was won by Pulitzer Prize winner, Middlesex.

The prioress's serving girl hurried up to her as she was leaving the church and told her that the prioress wanted to see her.<br>"Me?" asked Marie with a mixture of puzzlement and dread. "Why? "Why?" She tried to remember if she'd actually spoken any of her many censorious thoughts about the prioress out loud. Prioress Constance was a worldly, aristocratic widow, and Marie, a passionate idealist of nineteen, had nothing but contempt for her.<br>"I wouldn't know, my lady," said the girl, unconcerned. "Some knights have arrived with a message, and my lady told me to tell you to go see her as soon as the office ended."<br>Marie's throat tightened with apprehension. Knights with a message that concerned her could only have come from her father, Lord Guillaume Penthi�vre de Chalandrey, who was far away fighting on the crusade. Was he ill? Had he been awarded some honor by his overlord, the duke? Or--could he possibly have arranged for her to marry? For a moment she was standing in a cave at the back of her mind, smelling the stink that had filled the room at her mother's death: the scent of childbed fever, of sex, of marriage. She didn't want to marry, ever; she wanted to become a holy saint instead. She crossed herself and hurried unhappily to answer the prioress's summons.<br>She did not have far to go: St. Michael's priory consisted of a large house with a single small courtyard adjoining the church. It was not, of course, a part of the monks' ancient abbey that crowned the hill; it was situated in the town that clung to the rock below. It enjoyed the abbey's protection, however, and the same secure position above the waters of St. Michael's Bay kept it safe from the constant raiding and turmoil that plagued the Breton March. The nuns were all respectable noblewomen, and they accepted only well-born girls as novices--a respectability which had always frustrated Marie's ardent enthusiasm. The prioress's chambers were on the ground floor of the house. Even before she reached them she could hear Lady Constance's well-bred braying voice. It carried across the small cloister-court, punctuated by inaudible responses from the visitors. "No, no!" it exclaimed, just as Marie entered the dark porch. "She's a dear quiet girl, very modest and obedient; it's been a pleasure to have her here --do assure your lord of that! I'm sorry to summon her for such bad news, my lords, indeed I am, and I shall be very sorry to see her go."<br>Marie stopped dead, not listening for the still-inaudible reply. The oak door of the reception room before her was closed, while behind her the warm spring day continued smoothly in the sun. Bad news for her; so bad that she was expected to leave St. Michael's priory. She felt as though the threads that bound her heart to her mind had just been cut: she was aware that something had happened that would alter her life irrevocably, but it was an awareness without emotion. An onlooker inside her watched dispassionately to see what she, Marie Penthi�vre of Chalandrey, would do in a crisis. The only conscious thought her mind shaped was a prayer: "Oh God, don't let my father be dead!"<br>She raised her hand and rapped upon the door.<br>The room was full of people. Lady Constance, a strong-featured woman of fifty, was sitting on the high-backed oak chair, dressed in one of the embroidered and bejeweled habits that drew scandalized fulminations from the abbey up the hill. Three knights were standing before her: they all turned to look at Marie as she came in, and with relief she realized that she didn't know any of them. Bad news from home would have had a familiar messenger. The knights were all young men and they all held cups of the priory's wine. Their conical helmets sat in a row on the prioress's table. Two of the men wore plain hauberks--knee-length leather coats stitched all over with iron rings--while the armor of the third was finer, forged of very small interlinked rings, with a gilded cross-harness on the breast. The hauberk sleeves, as was usual, reached only to his elbows, and one could see that the tunic beneath was dyed scarlet and trimmed with marten fur. He was evidently a man of some wealth, and she guessed he was the leader of the party. He was fair-haired and clean-shaven, a handsome man with wide blue eyes and even white teeth which he started to show her in a smile, before visibly remembering that he was bringing her bad news and looking solemn.<br>"Marie, my dear," said Constance gently, "thank you for coming so promptly. Child, you must strengthen yourself and trust in our Lord Jesus Christ. I'm afraid that these gentlemen have brought bad news for you."<br>Marie crossed her hands on her breast and bowed her head. Her heart was still cut off, but there was a sick taste at the back of her mouth. "Lord Jesus Christ have mercy," she said. "My lords, what is your news?"<br>It was the fair-haired man in the fine armor who told her. His name, he said, was Alain de Foug�res; he and his companions had been sent by her father's overlord, the duke, to tell her that her brother Robert had been killed at the siege of Nicaea.<br>Marie had been braced for disaster, and its absence staggered her. She'd barely known her brother. He'd lived at the court of her father's overlord, Duke Robert of Normandy, since before she was born, serving the duke first as a page, then as a squire and a knight. He'd only returned to Chalandrey to bring home a silly wife who'd disliked Marie--and then he'd spent very little time there. She was shamefully aware that she felt a bitter jealousy toward him, the child her father loved, the heir all her world united to praise. But she'd prayed for him dutifully every day. He'd been a stout, cheerful man, fond of sweets and wine; she remembered him dancing the gavotte with his wife until his face was crimson. How could he be dead? She blinked at the fair-haired knight owlishly, and he looked back with an expression of dutiful solemnity. The silence lengthened. She realized that everyone expected her to say something, and, horribly embarrassed, she couldn't think what to say.<br>Into her numbed mind came one thought far too honest to be spoken aloud: if Robert were dead, their father would have to notice her at last. He never had, never, even though she tried to make herself modest and humble and pious, everything a gentlewoman should be; even though she had mastered the extraordinary accomplishment of learning to read. Marie's face went hot. It was wicked to be pleased at a brother's death. She pressed her crossed hands against her chest, feeling the heart pounding under the ridges of bone. One of the knights hurried over and set a stool down for her, and, dizzy with shame and embarrassment, she collapsed onto it with a thump.<br>Alain de Foug�res coughed, with the air of a man who's completed an unpleasant preliminary and reached the point where he can do the business he intended. "Because of this sad loss of that good knight your brother," he said, "my lord the duke has sent us to escort you to his court."<br>"What?" asked Marie faintly, then, more sharply, "What do you mean?"<br>"With your father away you are the duke's ward," Alain said, as though he were explaining it to a child. "Now that you've lost the other members of your family, it's his business to provide for you."<br>Marie's face went even hotter. She knew the feudal law as well as he did. A man's overlord was always the guardian of his widow or orphans. But she was not an orphan and she didn't see--<br>Suddenly, she did see. Her brother had no children, so, under the marriage settlement he had made, his widow would not inherit from him. Marie herself was now the heiress to the manor of Chalandrey--and, as an heiress, valuable. An arranged marriage to an heiress was a fine reward for any knight a feudal overlord was pleased with. The sick taste swam back into her throat, and she felt herself begin to tremble. "My father provided for me already!" she exclaimed, too shrilly. "He sent me here."<br>"For your safety, child," said Lady Constance gently. "Your father arranged for you to stay here while he was on crusade, but he was very emphatic that you weren't to take vows without his permission. Now that your circumstances have changed, you should go to court."<br>Marie stared at her frantically, trapped, then whirled back to Alain de Foug�res. "How could Duke Robert have sent you?" she demanded. "He's on the crusade with my father."<br>"I've come on the duke's authority," replied Alain. After a moment he added, "Duke Robert <i>has</i> left a steward, you know."<br>One of the other knights grinned. Marie looked from the grin back to Alain de Foug�res, trying to fight off the horror and force her stunned mind into motion. She felt as though she had just missed something, something important. But it was impossible to think clearly. She was bound to obey her father's overlord. Bound to marry at his command some total stranger, probably a man much older than herself. Bound thereafter to regard her husband as her lord and master, to accept humbly whatever treatment he gave her--and most husbands beat their wives at least occasionally. Bound to lower her body, awkward and private and vulnerable, into the feverish, bloody filth of childbirth. Bound to lose herself utterly. Choking on a panic without outlet, she pressed her hands against her face and burst into tears.<br>She left Mont St. Michel that same afternoon. Lady Constance told her that it was best to keep busy. "You know that you must obey your lord as you would obey your father himself," she said. "And since you're bound to go, it's best if you go at once. It won't do any good to brood. I'm sure you'll be well looked after at the duke's court, and these gentlemen will treat you kindly on the way there. You go and pack."<br>It was the prioress's serving girl, though, who packed up the few belongings Marie had brought with her to the convent. Marie could only sit on the narrow bed, her hands folded in her lap, praying. She was still shaking, but now only partly from fear, and largely from shame. The onlooker within had watched to see how she would behave in a crisis. It had seen wicked thoughts, craven terrors, and childish bursts of tears. Of the firmness and faith that should have gone with that much-sought-after holiness, there had been no trace.<br>The sun was still well above the horizon when Marie climbed, dazed, onto the rawboned gray mare that had carried her to the priory three years before, and set out with the three knights.<br>Lady Constance had been right in one thing at least: the journey instantly wrested Marie's mind from her own concerns. Her mare Dahut was what her father had approvingly termed "a good horse": she was strong, fast, and enduring. She was also an iron-mouthed, bad-tempered bone-shaker, and for three years she had been used by a motley assortment of priory servants, which had not improved her naturally contrary disposition. Marie had learned to ride as a small child, but had not been on a horse since arriving at the priory, and Dahut kept her so busy that for some miles she had no time even to look back. She did notice, though, when they turned to cross the Couesnon River into Brittany. She could hardly fail to notice that.<br>For sixty years the Couesnon had formed the boundary between the duchies of Normandy and Brittany. Though both nominally subject to the king of France, the two duchies were in fact virtually independent nations, and they were at war almost as often as they were at peace. Many Breton families, however, had a foothold on both sides of the river. Brittany was poor and Normandy was rich: What could be more natural than that poor Bretons, second and third sons with no part in the family inheritance, should seek their fortunes in the north? And if they succeeded, what prevented the lords of small estates in Brittany from getting big ones elsewhere? The many branches of the Penthi�vre family were the most eminent of all these allegiance-straddlers. Partly because of the glorious duplicity of more exalted Penthi�vre's, Marie's own, more modest branch of the family was absolute in its allegiance to Normandy. Guillaume Penthi�vre's father had left the service of the duke of Brittany and sworn fealty to Duke William the Conqueror, and that loyalty, Guillaume declared proudly, could not be retracted again without loss of the family's honor. He boasted of never having crossed the Couesnon.<br>Marie dragged her mare to a stop in front of the low wooden bridge. Dahut snorted and laid her ears back, jerking her head against the reins and shifting her feet in resentment. The three knights stopped, too, and turned back to fall in beside her. Behind her lay the empty expanse of salt marsh, and beyond that the pinnacle of Mont St. Michel, already four miles away but looking close enough to touch. The river before them flowed brown and smooth, the^ current so gentle that it seemed not to be moving at all.<br>"My lady?" asked Alain de Foug�res, speaking for all three, as usual. "Why have you stopped?"<br>Marie looked at him in confusion. "You're going the wrong way," she said--and winced inwardly at how timid and unsure of herself she sounded.<br>He hesitated, and one of the other knights looked at him in exasperation. Marie thought the exasperated man must be some kind of kin to his leader: they looked alike, though Alain's wide-featured good looks were exaggerated in his follower to a peculiar resemblance to a frog--a gap-toothed frog with sandy hair. The follower's name, she'd gathered, was Tiher. "Tell her the truth, Alain," he urged.<br>Alain hesitated a moment longer, then nodded, "Very well. Lady Marie, we're going to Rennes."<br>Marie stared. Rennes was the capital of one of the three great counties of Brittany. Again her heart was cut loose from her mind, and she felt unreal, as though this were happening to someone else. "You said we were going to Duke Robert's steward!" she protested.<br>"No," said Alain, looking enormously pleased with himself. "I said we were going to the court of the duke. Duke Hoel is presently at Rennes."<br>Duke Hoel of Brittany. Marie stared in incomprehension. Dahut seized her moment, jerked the reins out of Marie's hands, and sidled stiff-legged toward the lush grass at the side of the road. Marie hurriedly drove her heels in to start the horse back the way they'd come--but at this the bad-tempered mare laid her ears back and balked. Tiher was right beside her: he leaned over and caught her bridle, a gesture that might have been merely helpful but suddenly was not. With a froggy grin he looped the trailing reins over his own arm. This is an abduction, Marie thought in amazement. That was why I felt I was missing something. It wasn't that I was stupid; it was that they were deceiving me. Duke Hoel! Oh sweet Jesus, I should have thought! Of course the duke of Brittany would jump at a chance of getting hold bf a fine rich manor like Chalandrey!<br>"You lied to me!" she exclaimed furiously to Alain.<br>"I didn't lie," answered Alain righteously. "I told you that I had been sent to escort you to the duke who is your rightful overlord. That's true."<br>"My rightful overlord is Robert of Normandy!" protested Marie. "You told me you'd come on the...</p><h2>The Message Remix: The Bible in Contemporary Language (Tan, Pocket-Size)</h2><p>The Message//REMIX is purely, simply God&#x2019;s Word in its most easily understood language.

C. M. Woodhouse is uniquely qualified to write the history of Greece, having served there in the Allied military and the British embassy during and after World War II before writing several books on Greece. In this classic work, which Woodhouse has updated five times to create a truly comprehensive history, the depth of his knowledge and understanding of the country and its citizens comes through clearly in every chapter, as he ranges from the ascendancy and eventual fall of the Byzantine Empire through the emergence for the first time of a unified Greek kingdom in the 1800s to the political turmoil of twentieth-century politics. This is a book for readers and travelers who wish to understand the history and culture behind the beauty that is eternal Greece.<br></p><p><b>C. M. Woodhouse</b> is also the author of <i>The Philhellenes</i>; <i>Apple of Discord: A Survey of Recent Greek Politics</i>; <i>The Struggle for Greece, 1941-1949</i>; and many other books. He lives in England.<br>"It is in adversity that the particular merits of the Greek character are shown most brightly, and Woodhouse, whose affection for Greece is evident in everything he writes, is well qualified to bring out these merits."--<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"Whenever Woodhouse cares to write on Greece, his work will always be welcome, both to scholars and general readers."--<i>History</i><br></p><h2>The Lesser Bohemians</h2><p>From the writer of one of the most memorable debuts of recent years, a story of first love and redemption.

Now she returns to her cozy roots with her first Aurora--Roe--Teagarden mystery since Dead Over Heels. Roe and her new and considerably older husband Martin are settled into their new life quite nicely when everything changes with the arrival of Martin's niece Regina. The flighty Regina lands on their doorstep with a baby no one knew she was expecting, then disappears a few hours later leaving both the baby and her husband's brutally murdered corpse in her wake. Roe and Martin must try to answer all the questions in this sticky case: whodunnit, why, and where (as in, Where the heck did this baby come from?). Fans of Roe's earlier exploits and of Lily Bard will be delighted by Harris' reprisal of the Teagarden series. <br></p><p>Worldwide Mystery has enjoyed great success with the <i>Aurora Teagarden</i> mystery series by <b>Charlaine Harris</b> and is pleased to publish this fifth title. This prolific mystery writer is also well-known for her <i>Shakespeare, Arkansas</i> mysteries featuring Lily Bard.Aurora (Roe) Teagarden (Dead Over Heels, 1996, etc.) is enjoying newlywed life with businessman Martin Bartell in Lawrencetown, Georgia, when Martin's niece Regina from Ohio suddenly appears, accompanied by an infant named Hayden. Within the next 24 hours, Regina has disappeared, with her car but without her clothes or her baby; and her ne'er-do-well husband Craig has been found, a hatchet through his head, on the stairs leading to their garage apartment. Then his best friend and former jailmate Rory also turns up, appearing stunned by Craig's death. It's soon decided that Hayden will have to be brought back to Corinth, Ohio, where Martin grew up and where there are relatives who might take the baby in. Martin owns an old, refurbished farmhouse on the outskirts of town where Craig and Regina had been living. Now, he and Roe can stay there until matters are settled. Once arrived, Roe struggles with the complex details of child care as she and Martin try to find the reason for Regina's disappearance and a permanent home for the baby. Their neighbors Margaret and Luke Granberry try to be helpful, but Martin's sister Barby is off on a cruise and other possibilities for Hayden's care seem nonexistent. Then all hell breaks loose: Regina reappears; heroics abound, and heroism too, as the convoluted plot comes to its end. Gossipy, blithe, often funnywith a wind-up thats fierce, shocking, and poignant. A winner for Harris this time out. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Shaw, and works as a senior editor for a trade publishing magazine.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>Marla Mason sat in the branches of an ancient oak on a ridge, spying on the moonlit cemetery below. A tall elderly man with a walking stick stood near a freshly disturbed grave, supervising a pair of homeless ordinaries armed with shovels. A black goat chewed peacefully on the grass near the grave, tethered by a length of twine to the stone cross of a neighboring headstone.<br><br>"I can't believe we're sitting in a tree," Rondeau said, shifting on the branch next to her, but remembering to whisper, at least. "I'm ruining my pants."<br><br>"At least it's summer. Be glad we're not sitting in an ice-covered tree in winter. I told you we were doing a stakeout tonight. It's not my fault you decided to wear a leisure suit." She glanced at her morose colleague. "That shade of green doesn't even blend in with the foliage. I'm not sure that shade of green even exists in nature." She looked back down on the scene below. The tall man paced around the gradually emptying grave like an expectant 1950s father in a waiting room.<br><br>"Why do I have to be here again?" Rondeau said.<br><br>"Stakeouts are boring. You make them slightly less boring, what with your amusing complaints and comical discomfort."<br><br>"Wonderful. Remind me to cultivate greater dullness. I don't see why we need to spy on Ayres. We're in the business of hassling crazy people now?"<br><br>"We're not hassling Ayres. He doesn't even know we're here. We're just going to enforce the terms of his parole. Unless you want hordes of zombies running around all over town?"<br><br>"Fast zombies or slow zombies?"<br><br>Marla scowled at him, but he didn't take much notice. "What?"<br><br>"Well, the classic George Romero Night of the Living Dead zombies, shambling around slowly, there could be a certain pleasure in dealing with that, you know? Taking them out using shotguns and baseball bats, whack whack whack. Killing zombies is like killing Nazis. You don't even have to feel bad about it. It's like shooting rats at the dump. Very cathartic."<br><br>"You're a sick bastard, Rondeau."<br><br>He shrugged. "Fast zombies, though, like you see in movies nowadays, those are scary."<br><br>"Ayres makes real zombies." She considered. "Well, not actually like Haitian Vodoun zombies, either, I guess. He animates corpses to do his bidding. Not like movie zombies anyway."<br><br>"Oh, so the zombies aren't even contagious? I mean, if they bite you, you don't rise from the dead with a craving for brains? Hell. Those would be easy."<br><br>"Under the terms of his release, Ayres isn't supposed to practice necromancy. I insisted on that. And unless he's gotten into garden-variety grave-robbing, he's about to break his agreement."<br><br>"Why the restrictions, though? Dr. Husch said Ayres is cured. He's trying to become a contributing member of our little underground society again. I think you just have an irrational hatred for necromancers, ever since that guy Upchurch raised Somerset from the dead and you got your ass kicked."<br><br>Marla punched Rondeau in the arm, making him grab wildly for a branch to keep from tumbling out of the tree. "My ass was only kicked provisionally. I beat Somerset in the end. No, I've got personal reasons to want Ayres out of the picture."<br><br>"Why don't you ever tell me anything?"<br><br>"Sorcerers have secrets like surgeons have scalpels, Rondeau. Tools of the trade."<br><br>Marla didn't look at him, but she could sense Rondeau rolling his eyes. "Okay, whatever. So what's the goat for?"<br><br>"Sacrifice. Necromancy runs on blood. To make the dead speak, a few drops of the sorcerer's own blood will suffice. To raise a fresh human corpse, you don't need much blood&#x2014;just a rat or a pigeon. To raise older corpses or get a skeleton walking around, you need more blood, bigger sacrifices."<br><br>"That looks like a fresh grave they're digging up, so why's he going to kill that cute goat instead of a rat?"<br><br>Marla shrugged. "He's an old man, and it's easier to buy a goat than catch a rat? Or maybe it's because he's been out of practice for fifteen years? I don't know. I'm not a necromancer. Smelly, ugly business."<br><br>The men at the pit hauled the casket up out of the hole with ropes. Ayres paid them, and they left, brushing grave-dirt off their already filthy clothes. The necromancer watched them depart, then opened a satchel and drew out various jars and candles. The goat watched him with interest. Marla let him pour out a few lines of sand and powder on the grass, getting well into his ritual, before saying, "Okay, let's go break up this shindig."<br><br>She dropped out of the tree, her black cloak flapping behind her. She'd permanently retired her signature magical purple-and-white cloak&#x2014;she preferred using magic that didn't actually drive her insane, and this new cloak was purely decorative. It had silver trim and everything. Still, style counted for something, and at this point most of the denizens of Felport's magical underworld had a visceral reaction to the sight of Marla Mason wearing a cloak&#x2014;pretty much the way a field mouse reacts to the shadow of a hawk on the ground.<br><br>Rondeau came down after her, rather less gracefully, but he managed a lazy saunter by the time they were halfway down the hill. "Hey, Ayres!" Marla shouted. "You've been a bad boy!"<br><br>"Miss Mason," Ayres said, his voice about as sepulchral as could be expected. He rose from his preparations and hobbled toward her&#x2014;was he making a bigger show of being frail now that he knew she was watching? "I . . . am surprised to see you here. I would not think my actions would interest you."<br><br>"Rondeau, go untie the goat, take him back to the car, would you?"<br><br>"You're going to put a goat in the Bentley? I think the owner's manual advises against transporting livestock. It's bad for the leather."<br><br>Marla shooed him, and Rondeau complied, untying the goat and leading it away. The nibbles it was taking out of his pants would annoy him, once he noticed.<br><br>Marla turned to Ayres. "Of course I take an interest. You were clapped up in the nuthouse until a few days ago. Your release had one condition&#x2014;don't mess around with dead bodies&#x2014;and here you are, up to your armpits in dead people. Metaphorically. I can't have a rogue necromancer with mental health issues running around my city raising the dead unsupervised. It's bad for business. And morale. And tourism. And hygiene." She sat on the headstone, after glancing at the inscription to make sure it wasn't anyone she knew. Ayres had probably just picked the freshest-looking grave.<br><br>Ayres lowered himself carefully down to sit on the unopened casket. "I require a servant." He was unapologetic. "I'm an old man, and I need assistance."<br><br>"You can't raise the dead in Felport, Ayres. If you leave the city, you're out of my jurisdiction, and you can do whatever you want. Go down to Mexico&#x2014;there's lots of call for necromancy down there, I hear. Or fly up to Detroit. That lunatic Nain Rouge who runs the place could always use another corpse-grinder. But you can't do it here."<br><br>"This is my home. I helped make this city great. When Somerset ruled, during World War II and afterward, Felport was a colossus. What have you done?" He sneered. "Under Sauvage's reign, under yours, we've lost industry, the bridges are rusting, the bay is polluted, shipping has fallen off&#x2014;"<br><br>"That's not us, that's just the economy." She scowled. "Sauvage and I held disintegration at bay, damn it. Factories are leaving this country in droves, but we've turned Adler College into a world-class institution of higher education, we're cleaning up the parks, we're bringing in biotech companies and research firms and&#x2014;" She stopped. "Why am I justifying myself to you?"<br><br>"When the factories ran, when the smokestacks darkened the sky, when metal was forged and things were made here, Felport was a place of power, and Somerset tapped into it, he grew strong as the city did. What power can you draw from research, from ordinaries studying their incomplete histories in ivory towers? Bah."<br><br>"We do all right. It's a different world now, Ayres."<br><br>Ayres started to rise, then made a visible effort to remain calm, sinking back down. "I beg you to reconsider. I served the previous two administrations, and I could serve yours. I understand you have no necromancers of note in the city now, merely half-trained ronin, men who should be apprentices but lack masters to teach them."<br><br>"The city coroner, Dr. Matte, can coax a murdered corpse into telling us who killed him, and that's about all the need we have for necromancers these days."<br><br>Ayres leaned forward, his professional pride clearly wounded. "Those who communicate with the dead have far more uses than solving the petty crimes that afflict ordinaries." His voice had the reflexive contempt many old-line sorcerers exhibited when talking about mundane citizens, the great mass of people going about their lives unaware of the magical men and women and things in their midst. She didn't appreciate the attitude. Ninety-nine point nine percent of Felport's populace consisted of just such ordinaries, and Marla was sworn to protect the whole city, not just the sorcerers who lived there. Besides, she'd been an ordinary herself once, before being initiated into the mysteries. It was an argument she'd had many times with Felport's other sorcerers, who variously saw ordinaries as obstacles, experimental subjects, means to make money, or nuisances.<br>"Like what?" she said. "The last powerful necromancer we had in town, Upchurch, brought back the most horrible tyrant in Felport's history. He raised Somerset from the dead, and Somerset killed him for his trouble, before going on a crime spree and trying to take over the city. You know how hard it is to kill an undead sorcerer?" She shuddered. She'd developed a gut-deep hatred of the living dead in all their incarnations during that nightmare.<br><br>Ayres shifted under her gaze. "I knew Upchurch. He was my apprentice, and when I . . . became ill . . . he took over my position as Sauvage's advisor. He chose to resurrect Somerset for his own reasons, I'm sure. But think of it, Marla. I can call the shades of the city's great past leaders to consult with you. I can shield you from death, and call you back to life if you should die. If the city is ever threatened, I can raise an army of undying warriors to fight by your side. I can communicate with inhabitants of nether dimensions, and they have resources we can scarcely comprehend. I can be of use to you, Marla."<br><br>She took her dagger of office from the sheath at her belt and held it up to the moonlight, watching the reflection of light on metal. The dagger had a shining blade eight inches long, with a handle wrapped in alternating bands of white and purple electrical tape. The dagger never needed sharpening&#x2014;it was magical, passed from chief sorcerer to chief sorcerer over the decades, and could cut through anything, material or ethereal. The sight of Marla holding the dagger tended to unnerve people. "Nobody's doubting your qualifications. But you've been locked up for fifteen years. You just got out of a hospital for the criminally insane. It doesn't look good on a resume."<br><br>"I am fully cured. Dr. Husch can vouch for my&#x2014;"<br><br>"Ayres, you thought you were dead!" Dr. Husch had told her the condition was called the Cotard delusion. Those who suffered from the syndrome genuinely believed they were dead. Sometimes they thought they were being tormented in the afterlife, or believed they were wandering the world as ghosts, or thought they were zombies. Fifteen years ago Ayres had begun his constant complaints about the stench of rot, but at first, people thought it was just a side effect of his business&#x2014;it was too late when they realized he thought his own flesh was rotting.<br><br>"That was then. I now know I am very much alive." He tapped his walking stick on the grass, but that was his only sign of agitation. "Dr. Husch's therapies were most effective."<br><br>"You thought you were in Hell. You killed three innocent people because you thought they were demons!"<br><br>He bowed his head. "I know my crimes. I regret them deeply. I have paid for them. You cannot imagine the suffering I endured, Miss Mason. Aware of my own putrescence, smelling my own rot. Convinced I was dead and trapped in a Hell that simulated the streets of my beloved city, tormented by monsters who wore the faces of my friends, beasts with false smiles. Trying to play along with the charade of life, lest I be sent to some even more horrible and explicit Hell. That is penance, Miss Mason."<br><br>"Yeah, well, screw all that," she said, twirling the knife. "The real reason I won't give you a job is because you betrayed my city by raising Somerset from the dead."<br><br>He flinched. "I was imprisoned at the Blackwing Institute when that happened. I only heard about it secondhand. Upchurch was responsible&#x2014;"<br><br>"Upchurch was a hack. He wore a top hat, and white greasepaint to make his face look like a skull. When somebody tries that hard, you know they don't really have the chops. He was your apprentice. You told him to raise Somerset."<br><br>"You have no proof of these allegations."<br><br>She shrugged. "You were in low security back then, because Dr. Husch had decided you weren't a threat to others. You were allowed to walk the grounds at Blackwing, with supervision. You were allowed to have visitors. I know Upchurch visited you several times in the weeks before Somerset was resurrected&#x2014;I checked the logs. I don't know what you talked about, but I can guess. Somerset killed Sauvage. That guy was my friend." Sauvage was her predecessor as chief sorcerer, and they'd gotten close back when she was a freelancer living by her wits and her steel-toed boots. "If I hadn't stopped him, Felport would be a little piece of Hell on Earth now."<br><br>"Somerset was a great leader. Strong. Sometimes ruthless, it's true. I served him until he died, and then I served Sauvage, who was barely half the man Somerset was. He had no vision. But still, I worked for him loyally."<br><br>"Until he had you locked up, right, Ayres? That must have pissed you off. Somerset wouldn't have put you away&#x2014;he didn't care if the occasional ordinary got killed in the course of business. They were never part of his vision."<br><br>Ayres took a deep breath. "As I said, you have no proof. Your accusations are baseless."<br><br>Marla looked him over. He was old, yes, but far from broken. She'd hoped he would confess, but really, did it matter? "True. Upchurch was torn to bits by Somerset, and Dr. Matte couldn't put his skull back together well enough to make him speak after death. So yeah, all I've got is suspicions. But they're strong suspicions. If I had proof, you'd be dead by now.

And while the 800-page history that resulted from that work (as well as Brinkley's tireless, amply footnoted source work elsewhere) is comprehensive to a fault, the scope and enduring impact of the industrial colossus wrought by Henry Ford make it often seem like mere introduction. Brinkley's meticulous, enlightened work can't help but find endless fascination with the company's founder, whose presence resonates through every phase of the company's history, from its fitful start (FMC was the third company to bear the Ford name), through the rise of the Model T (still one of the most ubiquitous and revolutionary mechanical contrivances of the last millennia), to its cycles of corporate decay and rebirth (variously via Iacocca's Mustang in the 60's and the technical innovations and potent retrenchment of trans-nationalism in the 90's). Henry Ford remains one of the greatest human paradoxes in a century filled with them: a largely self-taught engineer who couldn't read a blueprint, yet became a mass-production visionary; an employer whose social conscience (and no small amount of shrewd business acumen) doubled the salary of his employees one era, employed thugs to crush their union organizing efforts the next; a world figure who read little, yet published much, including anti-war editorials and vile, anti-Semitic tracts--despite the fact that his monumental manufacturing facilities were designed by Jews whose friendship and professional relationships he cultivated. The enviro-social impact of Ford's industrial innovations continues to loom, and Brinkley hardly ignores them. But his research is largely focused on the rich players (and their often perplexing psychology) of the Ford saga, all-too-human characters whose ambitious empire will continue to cast its long shadows over many a generation to come. <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>Douglas Brinkley is professor of history and the director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the University of New Orleans.

It is a comically large tool, this corkscrew, like a cartoon prop, but it feels cold and sharp as it pushes its way through her body every morning, every afternoon, every evening, every hour and minute and second of every fucking day and every fucking night, coiling deeper in her before it reaches her margins and then rips its way back out in one brutal yank, uncorking her insides, spilling her guts, hollowing her out from belly button to backbone. The vacancy is palpable, a ragged hole like a cannonball blast through a tall ship&#x2019;s sail, setting the craft adrift. It feels like her organs are exposed: her stomach, ripped out, unable to contain food; her heart ruptured and pouring blood; her lungs perforated, air whistling a mournful dirge through the ragged flaps of tissue with every miserable breath she pulls through them. Louis felt a part of her, once, and now he is gone. And she is reminded of that pain moment to moment&#x2014;<br> <br>Because she is carrying his child.<br> <br>And that is the quite the ironic sensation, is it not? Louis is gone, and her middle feels ripped out&#x2014;even as she experiences the opposite sensation of walking around with a squirming fullness around her belly. It&#x2019;s as if the baby is not a baby but rather a black hole setting up shop inside her.<br> <br>As she walks up to the Dead Mermaid Hideaway here in Hesperia, California, she feels the baby in there.

The doc they found for her in Beverly Hills, Dr. Shahini&#x2014;with her enviable golden skin and those bold black eyelashes like the wings of a swallowtail butterfly&#x2014;said that Miriam&#x2019;s body should release chemicals that make her welcome the presence of the child. The chemicals, she said, would help Miriam feel &#x201c;at home&#x201d; with the baby inside her, but Miriam told her, &#x201c;Doc, my body doesn&#x2019;t make those chemicals.&#x201d; Because to this day, the baby feels like a parasite, an intruder&#x2014;<br> <br>(A trespasser)<br> <br>&#x2014;and mostly she just wants it gone. Gone because it reminds her of him. Gone because even in its fullness and agitation, it makes her feel hollow, empty, and painfully alone. And already she can hear Gabby chastising her inside her mind: It is not an it, Miriam; she is a her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s your daughter, not an end table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Feels like a fucking end table to me,&#x201d; Miriam grouses under her breath. &#x201c;God, what a great mom I&#x2019;m going to be.&#x201d; Like that matters. Right now, until she figures out a way forward, this child will barely be born before it dies&#x2014;robbed from the world at the moment of birth. From darkness to a brief flash of light, and then taken away again. Returned to the formless chaos from whence all things come. Life gone too quickly to where it usually goes slow: unmade into death.<br> <br>All part of fate&#x2019;s plan.<br> <br>But Miriam is Fate&#x2019;s Foe. She is the Riverbreaker.<br> <br>Fate will not write the end of this story. She will.<br> <br>Miriam swears to herself now, then, always: she will figure out how and why this kid&#x2014;this parasite, this end table&#x2014;is going to die, and she will save its life. Even if that means ending her own in the process. She owes that much to Louis. He is dead because she fucked up.<br> <br>This baby will not suffer the same fate.<br> <br>This baby will live.<br> <br>Deep breath, Miriam. In. Out. The baby squirms inside her.<br> <br>She takes out her cell and she texts Gabby: I&#x2019;m here, Dead Mermaid Hideaway.<br> <br>Gabby reponds: You&#x2019;re there early<br> <br>Miriam: No traffic.<br> <br>Gabby: Early is good<br> <br>Gabby: See Taylor yet?<br> <br>Taylor Bowman, the preening lackwit, and also the reason she&#x2019;s here.

Any luck?<br> <br>Gabby: None yet, will let you know<br> <br>Gabby: What&#x2019;s the place look like?<br> <br>Miriam looks up and describes what she sees: Awning has a fake mermaid skeleton draped across it. It&#x2019;s no lie. Someone has made a replica of a mermaid skeleton. It&#x2019;s a pretty good replica, too&#x2014;still has some fish scale on its bony tail, some fake webbing between the fingerbones. The red wig is maybe a bridge too far, but the clamshell bra seems a nice touch. She doesn&#x2019;t bother describing the other signs plastered awkwardly around the doorway in: LADIES DRINKS = 50 CENTS OFF and LOOTERS GET DEAD and FAMOUS FOR OUR GHOST PEPPER MARGARITA, whatever the fuck that is.<br> <br>Miriam adds: Shifty desert dive bar, except she doesn&#x2019;t mean shifty, because autocorrect corrected shitty, so then she has to fix it in all caps: SHITTY desert dive bar duck you autocorrect, which just pisses her off more and leads her to type in thumb-punching rage, ducking motherducker fuck shift shit duck it.<br> <br>Gabby: I told you, you should just put the profanity in your phone&#x2019;s dictionary.<br> <br>Miriam: It&#x2019;s not my phone and that sounds like work.

But when his old friend Cicero enlists the Finder in an elaborate plot to control Catilina, Gordianus is drawn back into a familiar world. Now caught in a cloak-and-dagger political struggle for the fate of the Republic, Gordianus finds himself strangely drawn to the controversial candidate. Is Catilina really a subversive renegade, or are Cicero suspicions part of an even greater conspiracy? When a headless corpse ominously appears on his farm, Gordianus knows he must unlock the secret of <i>Catilina's Riddle</i> before Rome tears herself apart.<br></p><p>My high school Latin teacher -- Sister Ethelreda, are you out there in cyberspace? -- enthralled her class for four years with her tales of ancient Rome, from culinary trivia to the deeds of the noble generals and the great Roman patriots. It was her hope, as she said, not only to teach us this beautiful language but to be able to bring to life for us the people who formed the vibrant culture that was Rome's. I heard an echo of her words many years later when I read THE FAR ARENA, in which the protagonist wished earnestly to be able to turn a doorknob in time and find the Roman behind the door.<br><br>With Steven Saylor's mysteries, we have that Roman behind the door. Set in ancient Rome before the rise of Julius Caesar, these are not your usual cozy reads. His detective, Gordianus the Finder, seems a scruffy sort, not a noble Roman from the history books by any means, and his Rome is a rough-and-tumble place full of noisy street vendors and con artists as well as more well-to-do, upstanding citizens, a city full of gossip and intrigue and nasty politics as vicious as anything we see today. The noble Romans do appear in his books, of course, but they're a far cry from the bloodless statues who watch serenely from the covers of Latin books as students painstakingly translate their dry speeches. Marcus Tullius Cicero, for one, appears in CATILINA'S RIDDLE not as a statesman but as an underhanded schemer obsessed with destroying Lucius Sergius Catilina, who has gone down in history, rightly or wrongly, as a man who attempted to bring down the Roman Republic.

Could Catilina really be conspiring against the Republic? Or are Cicero's accusation no more than vicious lies?

By the author of Families in Pain. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Phyllis Vine is an American historian who has taught at Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Michigan, Union College, and Barnard College.In this engaging narrative, Vine (Families in Pain) uses the harrowing prosecution of Dr. Ossian Sweet for murder to chronicle the deplorable state of race relations throughout the country in the early decades of the last century. Born in 1894 in the segregated town of Bartow, Fla., Sweet managed to obtain a medical degree, study in Europe and establish himself as a promising member of Detroit's emerging "black bourgeoisie" while still in his late 20s. Having witnessed a lynching as a seven-year-old child, Sweet was anything but na�ve about the dangers faced by blacks who tried to cross the racial divide that permeated every aspect of American society during the Jim Crow era. Vine sets the stage for the central courtroom drama by summarizing critical events that shaped the racial climate, which included the release of D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation, a reinvigorated Ku Klux Klan, rigid segregation and the exodus of Southern blacks to the factories of the North. Aware of these factors, Sweet kept a low profile when buying a house on a mainly white street in Detroit. Nevertheless, a mob assembled within a day and began hurling rocks and racial epithets. Not to be intimidated, Sweet and others in the house fired back at the crowd, killing one man and injuring another. Murder charges followed. Fortunately, the NAACP was able to persuade the renowned Clarence Darrow to take up the defense in 1925. In the end, Vine offers a stark reminder of our history of racial intolerance. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That's what Texas stereo repairman Ray Shackleford struggles to prove in this strenuous fantasy of rock- and-roll hits that never were. Shortly after his unloving father drowns in Cozumel, Ray starts to imagine he's hearing impossible songtracks that he's able to record directly from his head. He takes his tape of the Beatles' never- recorded hit ``The Long and Winding Road'' to L.A. producer Graham Hudson, who's already remastered three volumes of Glimpses from rock's legendary past, and Graham persuades him to go after bigger game. So Ray travels back in time, changing history enough so that Jim Morrison can record Celebration of the Lizard and Brian Wilson can persist in his breakthrough album Smile. There's money to be made here, of course, but what Ray and Graham really want is to save the world by recalling the aging rock audience to its ardent roots. (Maybe a little too ardent, as when Ray wonders, ``Was it that way for everybody, music and sex and politics and love all inextricably part of each other, or is it just me?'') Trying to come to terms with his hated father's death, Ray takes time out to retrace his steps in Cozumel, attempting to re-create his own experience of the 60's more directly in 1989, but his romance with a diving instructor seems to open wide the rift in his ten-year marriage without giving him a satisfactory alternative, and he ends up repeating his father's experience instead of accepting it. So it's back to the past for one last try--with a Jimi Hendrix album that Ray hopes can keep the 60's from ending. As you'd expect from versatile fantasist Shiner (Slam, 1990, etc.), Ray's attempts to keep the faith by resurrecting Jimi and laying his own father to rest are powerfully affecting. Much more than yuppie reunions like The Big Chill, this captures a generation's sweet, desperate yearning for the 60's--though it ends up as authentically woolly as the period. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It's cider-making time on Grandpa's apple farm, and the whole family helps. Alex and Abigail pick bright red apples and carry bushel baskets to the wagon. They stand along a conveyer belt helping to sort the perfect (eating) apples from the not-so-perfect (cider) apples. Later, they watch as the apples are chopped into what Grandpa calls "apple mush" and pressed into cider. The cider is bottled and sold, and the family celebrates the labor with glasses of the sweet drink. The comfortable, colorful art brings little ones up close to the process and gives them a good look at the conveyor belts and presses and other machinery involved; the scene of the apple orchard store, shelves filled with jams and honey, gallons of cider, and pies and doughnuts all neatly stacked for purchase, is especially nice. A double-page spread, "Cider Lore," following the story, provides wonderful tidbits about the cider-making process. An excellent resource for autumn units or to use in preparation for a trip to the orchard. <i>Helen Rosenberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Only the odd ones, by shape or color, are tossed into the chopper to make the apple mush. The mush then goes to the press where the juice is squeezed out. Once the cider is ready, the family opens the Apple Barn where they all help sell the apples, cider, and homemade jams and pastries. The realistic illustrations are soft with autumnal colors and show the process that results in that glass of cider. Although listed as fiction, there is more straightforward information than story.

How does your relationship now differ from the one you had with her then?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Puzzle is five and a half now. Though we had several hundred training searches together in the period covered in the book, we've had easily double that now. I have a lot more trust in her bond with me. She works pretty much exclusively off lead, and I no longer wonder if she'd abandon a search, run away from me to chase her own interests, or anything like that, as I did when she was very young. During her puppyhood, Puzzle was always interested in search work and joyful about finding people, but she seemed to regard me as an unnecessary chaperone for a job she'd do better alone.<p></p> As she matured, Puzzle seemed to recognize that part of her job was to work with me, to communicate with me, to insist when I'd missed some signal from her--and she seems to find joy in that part of the job too.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Is your relationship with Puzzle, as depicted in the book, typical of the kinds of relationships other SAR handlers have with their dogs? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Some situations in the book probably resonate with other handlers--maybe a few make them wince, or laugh at my failings outright--but <i>Scent of the Missing</i> by no means represents a "standard" dog-and-handler relationship. It's not a template or a guidebook for best practice. I compare this book to a memoir about a marriage or raising a child: a portrait of one relationship over a period of time--ideally magical, meaningful, and worthy of being shared.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What are these working dogs like at home as pets? What do they enjoy doing off duty?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Most of them enjoy being pretty typical dogs. They have favorite toys and games and preferred sleeping spots. They mooch car rides and sneak drinks from the toilet. Puzzle is a creature of routine. She likes to play bitey-face with one of the Pomeranians first thing in the morning. She adopted a kitten a couple of years ago; that kitten is now a cat, and the two of them cuddle and play quite a bit. Puzzle enjoys playing fetch and tug with humans. On rainy days she is keen to go outside and find the perfect mud puddle. Puzzle is happiest when she's absolutely filthy--a good puddle wallow, followed by a roll in the grass.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How long will Puzzle's search career run? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Until she shows me she can no longer do the job,or she no longer wants to do it, or until my own strength forces us to retire from the field. This work is physically rigorous, and I wouldn't push a dog whose condition was not up to it.<p></p> Nor would I run her if I couldn't do my part of the job. Usually the dogs grow too frail before they lose their interest, so it's likely the types of searches she could work would taper off as she ages. Some dogs retire from disaster or wilderness work, for example, but are still able to work for years on boat/drowning searches, which don't require running or climbing.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What happens to the dogs when they can no longer work searches?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Though there are exceptions with some teams, most search dogs retire as much-loved family members, living with the handlers they&#x2019;ve partnered. Some dogs are so driven to work that they learn new tasks. Puzzle is very pack-oriented, and though she's not a herder, I think she'd happily learn to round up the other family pets or to "find" them all in the house on command. She already enjoys knowing what's what and who's where in the household.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What characteristics give a dog a special aptitude for SAR?<p></p> <b>A:</b> This question sparks a lot of debate among handlers and evaluators, but most agree that a good SAR candidate demonstrates high energy, has natural curiosity, seems to enjoy scent games--and enjoys them enough to ignore distractions!--is willing to work on command for a human, and is confident in new situations. Physically, they need to be athletic and structurally sound, with no vision issues. While shepherds, retrievers, and hounds are popular breeds in the field, many breeds can do this work, and mixed breeds can certainly have the right gifts too.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> When you first began working ground searches, was there anything that surprised you?<p></p> <b>A:</b> The dogs surprised me. While I knew that dogs could do this job, I had no idea how well they communicated complex conditions of scent (for example, differences between "a little bit of old scent here" and "live scent, right here, right now" and "human scent here, but not live") and how difficult a job it is to decode them. The dogs communicate from nose to toes to tail, and they do it fast, so it's a lot of reading on the run. <p></p> I was also surprised by how tough terrain can be even in a city. Urban SAR can become wilderness SAR pretty quickly. In our area, when a housing development stops, it stops, and just beyond that wall can be acres and acres of brutal scrub. I've walked past million-dollar houses and, twenty steps later, beyond the community gates, had to press through a sector on my hands and knees, cutting my way through thorns.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What aptitude do humans have to bring to this work?<p></p> <b>A:</b> All kinds of stamina, physical, emotional, intellectual. A search can begin at what is, for search personnel, the end of a long workday. It can run all night and into the following day or days, in all kinds of weather across all kinds of terrain and in a state of emergency. Self control and a long fuse are useful. Physical soundness and a willingness to learn new things are important. It helps not to be a afraid of snakes, spiders, the dark, or tight spaces. It's also good not to be squeamish.<p></p> Handlers also need to really believe in the work of the dogs, to trust information that we humans can't see--or smell--and be able to let the dog do the work instead of trying to do it for him.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> You began search-and-rescue-related work as a pilot. Are there any similarities between searching from the air and searching behind a dog?<p></p> <b>A:</b> There are some surprising similarities. When I pass fields or wilderness areas in my car, I always think about how I'd land a plane on it, if I had to, or how I'd search it with a dog. Good pilots have an awareness of the ground they're flying over. In flight training, we sometimes look down at the terrain beneath us and hypothesize, "If my engine failed right now, where would I land? How would I set up that approach and that landing?" It's a matter of where the wind is coming from, how flat or rolling the terrain is, and what's growing on it. Working search with a dog, I have to take into account many of the same considerations. "If I had to search that valley, how would I set it up. Where would I start Puzzle, and which way would we work across it?" Again, it's a matter of where the wind is coming from, what kind of ground and vegetation has to be pressed through. Landing an aircraft is not just about managing the plane, it's about working the plane effectively across an environment. Working canine SAR is not just about running behind a dog; it's about making it possible for the dog to work well in an area that is always in a state of change, where scent is often twisted, lifted, or obstructed. <p></p> Flying and dog handling both also require focus, a good deal of self-control, and the ability to interpret subtle cues from dog or airplane--while either one is moving quickly!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How will your partnership with Puzzle affect what you will do with your next search dog?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I'd have to learn pretty quickly not to expect the next dog to be just like Puzzle, even if the two were the same breed. Other handlers on my team are partnering their second dogs, and though they were experienced handlers when they got dog number two and were able to sidestep some of the problems a new handler has to overcome, all agree that every dog is a completely new conversation, in a new language. Truly back to square one with a nose, four paws, and a tail. <p></p> Puzzle learned very well from watching certified SAR dog role models, and I expect that if she is able to search and demonstrate the work in training searches to dog number two early on, it would be good for her--she is a proud dog--and it would be good for the new dog too.<p></p> I have to say that even talking about a next dog is bittersweet. Though I'm a practical person, dedicated to this work, and know that dogs age and then leave us, it hurts to think I could ever step into a search field without Puzzle.<br> <p>(photo � Chris Moseley)</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: Personal Photos from Author Susannah Charleson of her Search and Rescue Dog, Puzzle</b> <br> <b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> </p> <b>Puzzle at Work</b> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> Misty, Susannah, and puppy Puzzle after her first training search </td> <td> <br> Puzzle standing by, ready to run <br> </td> <td> <br> Puzzle loves her job </td> <td> <br> Snow training, February 2010 </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br> <b>Puzzle at Play</b> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> Whaddya mean, I look guilty? </td><td> <br> The inverted nap.

But in the wake of the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, she became intrigued by a newspaper photograph of a diligent search and rescue dog alongside her exhausted handler.

So she began to volunteer.<p></p><br>After a time serving as an assistant for certified canine teams on the ground, Susannah qualified to train a dog of her own. Puzzle was no ordinary dog, however.

His views always appeared to me commercial and interested.</p> <p>Samuel Adams on Silas Deane</p> <p>Faced with the overwhelming superiority of the British military, the Continental Congress sent a secret agent to France in early 1776 to negotiate for diplomatic support, weapons, and other materials. This was Silas Deane, a merchant and former delegate to Congress who, along with Benedict Arnold, had been instrumental in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga from the British. Deane's cover story was that he was representing the trading firm of Morris and Willing.</p> <p>Deane was an unlikely agent: he had lived most of his life in Connecticut and spoke not a word of French. Benjamin Franklin thought Deane's best qualification for the job was that he was so clearly unqualified to be a secret agent that no one would suspect him of anything other than working for Morris and Willing.</p> <p>In Paris, Deane found a partner with the court savvy he lacked. Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais was at various times a watchmaker, a spy, a diplomat, and a playwright; he created the character of Figaro, who inspired operas by both Mozart and Rossini. Beaumarchais was also an arms dealer. Deane and Beaumarchais worked out a deal to send cannons, muskets, ammunition, and clothing to the Continental Army. Since American money was virtually worthless, Congress would pay for all this with tobacco.</p> <p>Amidst the complex negotiations, Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee to join Deane as America's commissioners to France. The mission was no longer secret; Franklin was too big a celebrity to go unnoticed. As for Lee, he was the youngest son in a wealthy and distinguished Virginia family. His brother, Richard Henry Lee, had introduced the motion for independence in Congress. Arthur Lee's intelligence was undeniable-he was both a doctor and a lawyer-but it was, unfortunately, matched by his arrogance and tactlessness. John Adams, who generally allied himself with the Lees in Congress, said of Arthur Lee that "his judgment of men and things is often wrong."</p> <p>Franklin set about charming the French court and nation. Lee quickly offended both French diplomats and his fellow American commissioners, especially Deane. When the feud between Deane and Lee spilled over into the halls of Congress, it split its members publicly as no issue had since independence.</p> <p>� � �</p> <p>Even before Lee arrived in Paris, he was distressed by Deane's dealings with Beaumarchais. Lee had met Beaumarchais in London in 1775 and, without authorization from Congress, had taken it upon himself to negotiate an arms-for-tobacco deal. Nothing had come of those negotiations, but Lee worried that Deane might get the credit for his earlier efforts. Deane and Franklin further antagonized Lee by largely excluding him from their negotiations with the French.</p> <p>Deane's and Franklin's negotiations paid off in 1777, when Beaumarchais's ships sailed to America loaded with arms and other material for the army. The material made its way to Saratoga, as did American volunteers, encouraged by word that they had what they needed to fight the British. The American victory at Saratoga that fall was a turning point in the war. After Saratoga, British military operations were largely limited to the South.</p> <p>The victory didn't stop Lee from complaining to his brothers and others in Congress. He accused both Deane and Franklin of profiting personally from the French deals. He claimed there was no reason to pay Beaumarchais, since the arms were a gift from the French government. And he accused Edward Bancroft, the secretary to the American commissioners, of being a British spy. This last accusation turned out to be true, as British archives revealed when they were made public a century later.</p> <p>Deane was increasingly exasperated. Lee "must be shaved and bled, or he will actually be made for life," Deane wrote in January 1778. Franklin stopped answering Lee's letters, explaining that he did so because of "my pity of your sick mind, which is forever tormenting itself, with jealousies, suspicions and fancies that others mean you ill, wrong you, or fail in respect for you."</p> <p>Lee's complaints ultimately forced Congress to act. In early 1778, Congress recalled Deane from France, replacing him with John Adams, and opened an investigation into Deane's conduct.</p> <p>Lee's supporters in Congress charged that Deane had granted nearly sixty commissions to French gentlemen, making them officers in the Continental Army even though many were unqualified and the army could not afford to pay them. This was true, though Deane thought his actions necessary to gain the favor of the French court. Besides, not all his commissions turned out to be problems; among the Frenchmen who joined the Continental Army was the Marquis de Lafayette, who became one of Washington's most trusted officers.</p> <p>The more serious accusation was that Deane had used his mission for personal profit. Richard Henry Lee called as a witness William Carmichael, a merchant who had worked as secretary to Deane and Franklin. Lee announced to Congress that Carmichael would show that "Deane had misapplied the public money." Carmichael's actual testimony was inconclusive, since he admitted he did not recall many details of Deane's transactions. Arthur Lee's supporters also introduced Arthur's own letters as evidence, though these were too obviously biased to be of much use as evidence.</p> <p>Beaumarchais rose to Deane's defense. In a letter to Congress, he wrote that he had arranged for the arms shipments after Deane had promised him Congress would pay for them. Beaumarchais added, "I certify that if my zeal, my money advances, and shipments of munitions and merchandise have been agreeable to the noble Congress, their gratitude is due to the indefatigable exertions of Mr. Deane."</p> <p>Franklin, too, wrote on Deane's behalf, calling him "a faithful, active, and able minister, who to my knowledge has done in various ways great and important services to his country."</p> <p>Also testifying on Deane's behalf was Conrad Gerard, the new French ambassador. He reiterated that the French government wanted nothing more to do with Arthur Lee.</p> <p>Appearing before Congress, Deane stressed that he was eager to show that he had not "applied one shilling of the public moneys to my own use." He added, "It is well known that my private fortune in America, which at the time I left my country was moderate, has not been augmented, but the contrary, by my absence." He had brought virtually nothing back from France "excepting my clothes."</p> <p>Deane's defense was hampered by having left his account books in France. Even if he had brought them, they would have been confusing. In order to conceal the secret arms deals and preserve his initial cover story that he was merely an agent for Morris and Willing, Deane had mixed his public and private transactions. It also didn't help his case that, while waiting to testify before Congress, Deane lodged with Benedict Arnold. Arnold had not yet turned traitor, but his opulent lifestyle and his flirtation with a loyalist's daughter made him an object of suspicion.</p> <p>Both sides took their case to the public. In an essay in the Pennsylvania Packet, Deane blamed Lee for almost derailing the mission by offending the French and charged him with passing on intelligence to the British. He accused Congress of refusing to hear his side of the story, since "their ears have been shut against me."</p> <p>The Lees and their supporters recruited Thomas Paine to write a response in the same newspaper. Paine was appalled by Deane's "barbarous, unmanly, and unsupported attack" on Lee. Paine repeated Lee's claims that the French military supplies had been a gift, that there was no need to repay Beaumarchais, and that Deane had embezzled public funds. Lest there be any doubt of his credentials, Paine signed off as "Common Sense," the title of the pamphlet he'd written that many credited with inspiring Americans to support the Revolution.</p> <p>The feud between Deane and Lee polarized Congress as never before. John Adams feared the affair would end with either "the ruin of Mr. Deane, or the ruin of his country." George Washington moaned that "party disputes and personal quarrels are the great business of the day whilst the momentous concerns of an empire-a great and accumulated debt-ruined finances-depreciated money-and want of credit...are but secondary considerations and postponed...as if our affairs wore the most promising aspect."</p> <p>This was clearly more than a matter of difficult personalities, however disagreeable Lee was. The Lees and their supporters were appalled by the way Deane mixed personal and government business. "What Mr. Deane's political principles were if he had any I never could learn," wrote Samuel Adams. "His views always appeared to me commercial and interested." Asked Paine: "To what a degree of corruption must we sink if our delegates and ambassadors are to be admitted to carry on a private partnership in trade?"</p> <p>For Robert Morris, who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence as well as a partner in the firm that had provided Deane's cover story in France, there was no conflict between the pursuit of private wealth and the nation's interest. "I do not conceive that the state I live in has any right or inclination to enquire into what mercantile connection I have had or now have with Mr. Deane or with any other person," he wrote. "As I did not, by becoming a delegate for the state of Pennsylvania, relinquish my right of forming mercantile connections, I was unquestionably at liberty to form such with Mr. Deane."</p> <p>The divide was also regional. Like most of those who supported John Adams and Richard Henry Lee in their fight for a declaration of independence, Arthur Lee's supporters came mostly from the states of New England and the South, whose wealth came primarily from agriculture. Deane's supporters were mostly from New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, where commercial and financial interests were more dominant. The economic problems brought on by the Revolution exacerbated these tensions.</p> <p>� � �</p> <p>The Lees had resented Franklin since the early 1770s, when he had represented a company that was competing with the Lees for a grant of land in the Ohio Valley. In September 1778, Richard Henry Lee wrote Arthur Lee that Franklin was "immoral" and that "the doctor is old and must soon be called to account for his misdeeds." But in publicly attacking Franklin-already an American icon-the Lees went too far. They alienated potential congressional allies and ended up strengthening support for Deane.</p> <p>And, overall, Deane's defense in Congress was convincing. In January 1779, Congress unanimously agreed that Lee's claim that the French supplies were a present was untrue. Indeed, the debate in Congress turned from Deane's conduct to Lee's, and a vote to recall Lee from France failed by a single vote.</p> <p>Lee's reputation never recovered. He was elected to Congress in 1781 but then further alienated many of his family's previous allies, including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. He made clear to George Washington that he wanted to be a justice of the Supreme Court or the secretary of the treasury, but the president never named him to any post.</p> <p>Deane's reputation also spiraled downward. The attacks in Congress left him disillusioned about American democracy, and he returned to France in 1780. "We ought to inquire if any country ever was, for any time, even for one century at peace, free, and happy under a democracy," Deane wrote. British spies got their hands on this and other letters expressing similar sentiments and, recognizing their propaganda value, leaked them to American loyalists. The letters soon appeared in a New York newspaper, The Royal Gazette.</p> <p>Deane pointed out these were his private letters, not meant for publication, and he also claimed the British had doctored them. But he didn't deny he had lost faith in the Revolution. "You believe that the peace, liberty, and happiness of our country will be best secured...under an independent democracy," he wrote Franklin. "I have the misfortune to think differently."</p></p><h2>Something Strange and Deadly (Something Strange and Deadly Trilogy, 1)</h2><p><p>Sixteen-year-old Eleanor Fitt&#x2019;s brother is missing.

Follow him into the Pagan heartland of Pennsylvania where he fell in love, got in a roadhouse brawl over a honky-tonk angel, and eventually went to jail for "takin' care a club business." Now after a career as a journalist and college professor, he returns to the violent days of his youth and smashes up stereotypes like he once smashed up bars, resurrecting long-dead brothers, in a style reminiscent of Jack Kerouac and Mark Twain.&nbsp; Hall presents them as they really were: hard living, hard loving, hard drinking, hard fighting rebels, but also hardworking, patriotic, loyal, and lovable characters, and a band of brothers whose outlandish behavior forged an all-American outlaw legend in the tradition of Jesse James, Doc Holliday, John Dillinger, and Pretty Boy Floyd.&nbsp; Outlaws yes, but outlaws as American as apple pie.</p></p><p><p></p>In the 1960s, John Hall, a Harley-riding hell-raiser, hooked up with the Pagans, a group of like-minded individuals who went on to become the largest outlaw motorcycle club on the East Coast. Hall and the Pagans rode roughshod across the Eastern Seaboard throughout the 1960s, until John and six other Pagans ended up in the Pennsylvania State Penitentiary. While in prison John began taking college classes and earned several degrees.&nbsp;Now after a career as a journalist and college professor, he returns to the violent days of his youth and smashes up stereotypes like he once smashed up bars, resurrecting long-dead brothers in a writing style that is part Raymond Carver and part Jack Kerouac. Hall presents the Pagans as they really were: hard-living, hard-loving, hard-drinking, hard-fighting rebels, but also hardworking patriots, loyal, lovable characters, a band of brothers whose outlandish behavior forged an all-American outlaw legend in the tradition of Jesse James, Doc Holliday, John Dillinger, and Pretty Boy Floyd.&nbsp;<i>Riding on the Edge: A Motorcycle Outlaw&#x2019;s Tale</i> tells the story of John and the Pagans as they rode hard through the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, doing their damnedest to die young and leave good-looking corpses.&nbsp;<b>Bikernet.com </b>&#x201c;This is a good story about a lifestyle and chapter in American history that we will never see again.

If rival gangs, bar brawls or bike accidents don&#x2019;t kill them, years of hard drinking and hard living usually do. Documenting historical sociological connections to the beliefs and brotherhood of medieval Vikings, Hall paints a sometimes entertaining, occasionally chilling picture of men who live beyond the boundaries of our society yet will do anything to uphold the sacred values and tradition of their heritage.

Anger, guilt, anxiety, grief, empathy, joy and love are anatomized in turn, enlivened with research on everything from the role of monoamine oxidase A in anger to the engagement of opioid receptors as we thrill to music. And who knew that surrealist Salvador Dali created an art installation in the shape of a giant caterpillar to explore the process of sedation?&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2014;Nature</b></i><br>&nbsp;<br>Is science ever enough to explain why we feel the way we feel?</b><br><br>In this engaging account, renowned neuroscientist Giovanni Frazzetto blends cutting-edge scientific research with personal stories to reveal how our brains generate our emotions. He demonstrates that while modern science has expanded our knowledge, investigating art, literature, and philosophy is equally crucial to unraveling the brain&#x2019;s secrets. What can a brain scan, or our reaction to a Caravaggio painting, reveal about the deep seat of guilt? Can ancient remedies fight sadness more effectively than antidepressants? What can writing poetry tell us about how joy works? Structured in seven chapters encompassing common human emotions&#x2014;anger, guilt, anxiety, grief, empathy, joy, and love&#x2014;<i>Joy, Guilt, Anger, Love</i> offers a way of thinking about science and art that will help us to more fully understand ourselves and how we feel.</p><p><b>Giovanni Frazzetto</b> was born and grew up in the southeast of Sicily.

He lives and works in London and Berlin.&#x201c;In Frazzetto&#x2019;s book, the Italian researcher and writer offers a fine primer on six emotions plus empathy. But before diving into the biology of each emotion (the role of the amygdala in fear and of serotonin reuptake in grief), he inspects his target through the lenses of psychology, philosophy, art and personal experience.

It&#39;s been one hundred years since the House of Cartier opened its doors on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Since then the luxury jeweler has been creating exquisite brooches, bracelets, tiaras, timepieces, and other items including scent bottles, so-called mystery clocks, and handbags many of them specially commissioned by their illustrious patrons. Readers will see up close Gloria Swanson&#39;s bracelets from Sunset Boulevard, Douglas Fairbanks s elegant watch, the Duchess of Windsor s panther brooch, and Grace Kelly s 10.47-carat diamond engagement ring, as well as items owned by Marion Davies, Vivien Leigh, Barbara Hutton, and Elizabeth Taylor. Author Martin Chapman offers an in-depth exploration of how Cartier conquered America, from its European birth in 1847 to its arrival on the other side of the Atlantic, and from its whimsical Art Deco creations to the red carpet prominence that linked the name Cartier with fame, wealth, and exclusivity. In addition to stunning color images of each object, the book features photographs of stars and heiresses wearing their Cartier jewelry. A beautiful volume for fashion aficionados, this trove of jewelry is a tribute to Cartier s ingenuity and unmatched craftsmanship.</p><p>MARTIN CHAPMAN is curator of European decorative arts and sculpture at Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, CA, and was formerly curator at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA. A prolific writer on the decorative arts, Chapman has lectured widely in England, Europe and the United States.</p><h2>Wisdom and the Senses: The Way of Creativity</h2><p>Drawing on the Eriksonian theory of the life cycle, a parallel is shown between the growth and creation of self and the creation of art, focusing on the utilization of the senses as an integral part of achieving our potential</p><p>Joan Mowat Erikson was born in Canada; she earned her B.A. in Education at Columbia University and an M.A. in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. She is a teacher, writer, and craftsman and has worked with gold, silver, and precious stones. She is the author of a previous book, The Universal Bead. She is married to the noted psychoanalyst Erik H. Erikson.This intelligent, idiosyncratic examination of the intellectual and emotional life cycle enlarges on Erik Erikson's now institutionalized psychological development theory, the basis for his former co-author and wife's present study of art's contribution to the wisdom attributed to old age. Hypothesizing that "creative experience demands of us only that which is genuinely our own . . . our personal, accrued store of sense data," Mrs. Erikson calls upon her fund of knowledge about Eastern and Western philosophy, the creative arts, and the lives of her dedicated artist friends to offer readers with imagination an engaging study of the play between creating and aging.

Detailed Parliamentary plans were drawn up for hundreds of proposed railway schemes (many of which never got past the drawing board). Once built, the Ordnance Survey then plotted the lines onto their national maps of Britain. Cartographers such as John Barthomolew &amp; Son, Cruchley and Bradshaw, were commissioned to draw vast numbers of railway maps during the boom years. Maps were produced as an aid to the management of the railways; to promote the railway companies&#x2019; networks; and to enable passengers to plan their journeys, then understand the passing scene as they gazed from the carriage window.&nbsp;Thirty mileposts describe the history of the railways; Alongside the maps are a series of "milepost" features which give a detailed description of key events and eras in the history of Britain&#x2019;s railways. The nineteenth century saw the foundations laid for our modern railway network, with huge building projects constructing thousands of miles of track, bridges, and tunnels. This expansion slowed in the early twentieth century as competition from the car and the lorry began to bite. The railways made an enormous contribution to the World Wars, then underwent massive re-equipment after nationalisation, before changing drastically following the famous "Beeching Report" of 1963. The modern era has seen an expansion of the network again, with the Channel Tunnel built, and branch lines closed in the 1960s re-opening for business in the later years of public ownership and the first two decades of the privatised railway.</p><p><b>Julian Holland</b> is a&nbsp;specialist railway author, whose recent titles include <i>The Lost Joy of Railways</i>, <i>Amazing and Extraordinary Railway Facts</i>, and <i>Discovering Scotland's Lost Railways</i>. <b>David Spaven</b> is a&nbsp;rail consultant by profession, a geographer by background, and a railway enthusiast since childhood.

In June of that year, however, the lord president of the Council of Jamaica received a disturbing letter from the island&#x2019;s governor, Thomas Lynch: &#x201c;One Bannister ran away with a ship, the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>of thirty or forty guns, picked up over a hundred men from sloops and from lee- ward [at Port Royal], and has got a French commission.&#x201d;<br> Bannister, in fact, had no commission, but he most certainly had stolen the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>and he&#x2019;d done so with a single purpose&#x2014;to turn pirate. His actions hardly could have been bolder. It was near unheard of for a transatlantic captain, especially one as well regarded and trusted as Bannister, to &#x201c;go on the account,&#x201d; as it was said of pirating. Even in Port Royal, where everything happened, few had seen anything like this.<br><br> Lynch didn&#x2019;t sit around and wait for Bannister to return to his senses. Instead, he ordered the <i>Ruby, </i>the biggest and deadliest war- ship in the Jamaica fleet, to go after the <i>Golden Fleece. </i>A monster rated at 540 tons, with forty-eight cannons and a crew of 150, the <i>Ruby </i>was a pirate killer down to her timbers.<br><br> Bannister did not intend to make it easy for Lynch&#x2019;s enforcers. Since stealing the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>he had picked up additional crew, robbed a Spanish vessel, and made his way to the Cayman Islands to take turtles and gather wood. But the <i>Ruby </i>surprised him there, and her captain, David Mitchell, and his crew captured Bannister and put an end to his six-week pirate career.<br> Lynch was delighted.<br><br> &#x201c;Last night,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;the <i>Ruby </i>brought in Bannister. He took him at Caymanos; he has about 115 men on board, most of the veriest rogues in these Indies. I have ordered the ship and the men to be de- livered into the Admiralty and commanded the judge immediately to proceed against them, because we do not know how to secure or keep such a number. We conclude they&#x2019;ll be found guilty of piracy.&#x201d;<br><br> The case against Bannister was airtight. Not only had he stolen the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>he had taken two Spaniards captive after attacking their boat. The testimony of those two men alone would secure a conviction. By now, Bannister could only hope for leniency, but if he expected it, he&#x2019;d chosen the wrong governor under which to become pirate.<br><br> &#x201c;I intend if it proves so to make a terrible example of the captain, his lieutenant, officers, and all the men that have committed other crimes as many of them have,&#x201d; Lynch wrote, &#x201c;and hope the severity may have some influence on the other rogues that swarm in these In- dies.&#x201d;<br> By that, Lynch meant Bannister would hang. His crew, if lucky, might be whipped, jailed, or put into irons or stockades. If unlucky, they might follow Bannister to the gallows.<br><br> The pirates were returned to Port Royal and held aboard the <i>Ruby </i>pending trial. One might have expected Bannister to use the time to pen letters of good-bye or to contemplate eternity; instead, he waited for a break in his captors&#x2019; attention, then managed to get word to on- shore associates to bribe the two Spanish witnesses against him. It was an audacious plan and one that, even if the connections were made, seemed doomed given that the Spaniards had been rescued by the Royal Navy.<br><br> At trial, a strong case was made against the pirates. But when it came time for the Spaniards to testify, they swore &#x201c;backward and for- ward&#x201d; that they had sold their boat and cargo to Bannister, and that he had paid them to serve as crew aboard the <i>Golden Fleece</i>.<br><br> If that testimony shocked the prosecution, at least the governor could still rely on the jury, who were certain to see through the ruse. But this was Port Royal, where ordinary folk, remembering who&#x2019;d made their town rich and had infused it with spirit, still counted pi- rates as neighbors and friends. They returned with a verdict: not guilty. Bannister had cheated the hangman.<br><br> Already a sick man, Lynch suffered &#x201c;such disturbance of mind&#x201d; from the verdict that, according to accounts, he died of it a week later. By all rights, his replacement should have set Bannister free. Instead, Hender Molesworth tried to convince the jury to reverse itself, but the jurors wouldn&#x2019;t budge. Worse, Bannister threatened to sue the captain of the <i>Ruby, </i>&#x201c;as though [Bannister] were the honestest man in the world.&#x201d; That was more than Molesworth could take. Stretching the boundaries of the law&#x2014;if not breaking them&#x2014;he had Bannister re- arrested and charged. Bail was set at three hundred pounds, a staggering amount in an age when the annual wage for a seaman might be twenty pounds.<br><br> Somehow, Bannister raised the money and, at least for the moment, remained free. He was not, however, permitted to leave Port Royal, and in any case was likely too broke to do it. To make certain he entertained no thoughts of fleeing, officials cut down the sails of the <i>Golden Fleece</i>. By January 1685, five months after the original charges against him were thrown out, Bannister was still languishing in Port Royal, waiting to be retried.<br><br> He was still waiting when, on a dark night in late January, he began to make his way through the narrow streets of Port Royal. As he crept past taverns and brothels and sleeping families, fifty men were already at work aboard the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>moving furiously but making no sound. Before long, Bannister reached Thames Street, which ran along the wharf on the northern side of town. There, he rushed for the<i>Golden Fleece, </i>tied up at the docks, and stole aboard his former ship. Sails were hoisted and lines cut, and soon the vessel picked up the breeze and moved out into the harbor.<br><br> Landlocked to the east, the harbor offered only one way out, to the south, and that is where Bannister steered. To make it into the open Caribbean, he had to hope that no one in town noticed the <i>Golden Fleece </i>missing, or sounded the alarm at the sight of a ship moving in the dead of night. Even then, he would have to pass the twenty-six cannons at Fort James and, in the unlikely event he were still living after that, turn south and get by the thirty-eight cannons, and hundreds of men, at Fort Charles. At any point along the way, he might be spotted by Royal Navy ships anchored just a mile to the west, or by men at work in nearby Chocolata Hole. If such a thing as a suicide mission existed in seventeenth-century Port Royal, Joseph Bannister had just embarked on it.<br><br> Generally, winds were calm at night in Port Royal, but on this evening Bannister picked up a fresh breeze off the land and began moving west along the town&#x2019;s docks, maybe as fast as five knots, or about six miles per hour. Before long, he reached Fort James. Per- haps because of the hour, or because the garrisons there never expected such an unlikely event, it seems no one fired on the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>or even took notice of her. For the moment, Bannister and his crew remained safe.<br> Now rounding Port Royal&#x2019;s western shore, Bannister headed south toward Fort Charles, about a half mile in the distance. By now, he might have been fifteen minutes into his rush toward freedom, but he had at least another fifteen minutes to go&#x2014;critical moments that would determine whether he and his crew lived or died.<br><br> Soon, he could see the guns at Fort Charles, the most heavily fortified place in all of Jamaica. Staying within a few hundred yards of the shore, he ordered his men to ready their &#x201c;plugs,&#x201d; chunks of mattress or wood they&#x2019;d brought to fill holes in the ship they knew would be made when the cannons at Fort Charles began firing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> A moment later he was at the northern end of the fort and sailing the <i>Golden Fleece </i>for all she was worth, waiting for the explosion of cannons but hearing nothing more than the wind in his sails and the crashing of waves against his ship. He was perhaps ten minutes from freedom, but they would be the most dangerous minutes of his life.<br> Passing the first of the cannons, he braced for destruction. Any one of the guns at Fort Charles could be deadly from a half mile. Thirty- eight of them together, aimed at a single enemy just a few hundred yards away, couldn&#x2019;t miss.<br><br> Bannister kept sailing, passing more of the guns, waiting for explosions, drawing nearer to the open Caribbean. Now abreast of Fort Charles, he might have begun to have hope of slipping by undetected, but as he passed the fourteenth cannon, someone at Fort Charles caught sight of him and notified Major Beckford, the fort&#x2019;s commander. Moments later, Beckford sounded the alarm and ordered his cannoneers into action.<br><br> Never before fired in anger, the guns at Fort Charles rang furiously now, a series of concussions that shook all of Port Royal and must have caused townsfolk to think a foreign force was invading. At the sound, local militiamen would have been roused by their duty officer and run toward Fort Charles with their muskets. Now that the town was alert, Bannister&#x2019;s only hope was that darkness would conceal him.<br><br> He would not be so lucky.<br><br> Cannonballs slammed into the <i>Golden Fleece, </i>first one, then an- other, then a third, but Bannister&#x2019;s men stuffed the splintered holes with plugs, and the ship kept sailing, and even though the cannons continued to roar the rounds began to fall short, and in a few minutes the <i>Golden Fleece </i>had reached the open seas, and in another few she disappeared into the mist. By now, the navy ships would have been roused to action, but they were almost certainly anchored and could not hope to get going so suddenly, and soon the <i>Golden Fleece </i>and her captain were gone.<br><br> Bannister&#x2019;s escape blindsided Governor Molesworth. Still, he couldn&#x2019;t hide a grudging respect for the captain. Writing to an English colonial official, he said of the getaway: &#x201c;[It came as] a great surprise to me, for I thought Bannister&#x2019;s want of credit would prevent him from ever getting the ship to sea again . . . yet now he has obtained credit from some persons underhand, and has his ship well fitted in every respect. It was done so artfully that no one suspected it, or I should have found some pretext for securing him.&#x201d;<br><br> Impressed though he might be, Molesworth wasted little time in going after Bannister, sending Captain Edward Stanley in the four-gun sloop <i>Boneta </i>to hunt down the <i>Golden Fleece</i>. A light ship with a crew of perhaps ten, the ship was likely the smallest in the Jamaica fleet, but Bannister had surrendered to the navy with little struggle months earlier, and Molesworth surely expected more of the same.<br><br> For all she lacked in size, the <i>Boneta </i>was fast, and it didn&#x2019;t take her long to catch up to the <i>Golden Fleece</i>. When she did, however, Captain Stanley thought better of engaging the more powerful ship and her thirty guns. Instead, he sent a note to Bannister warning that he would face new charges for piracy unless he returned to Port Royal with the <i>Golden Fleece</i>. Bannister denied being a pirate, telling Stanley he was simply headed to the bay of Honduras for logwood. Helpless to do more, Stanley sailed back to Port Royal empty-handed.<br><br> Bannister wasted little time adding to his pirate crew, recruiting tough guys looking for adventure and a fast path to riches&#x2014;brave men who understood, with Bannister&#x2019;s new reputation, that the Royal Navy was coming, and that they would be pursued by merciless hunters charged with bringing them down.<br> By now, Molesworth must have realized that Bannister did not in- tend to go gently. He sent warships to chase every report of Bannister&#x2019;s plunders, but when the frigates arrived they were always too late. This continued for months as Bannister took prizes across the Caribbean and Atlantic.<br><br> In April, however, Molesworth caught a break. The <i>Ruby </i>had tracked Bannister to the �le-�-Vache, a small island off the southwestern tip of Hispaniola (now Haiti), a notorious pirate hangout, and a place once used by Henry Morgan as an operating base. But as Captain Mitchell closed in, he found not one pirate ship but five, each nearly the size of his own. The <i>Golden Fleece </i>was among them, and Bannister was in the company of four French privateers, including the infamous Michel de Grammont.<br><br> Against any one of these pirates the <i>Ruby </i>held an advantage. Against them all, she couldn&#x2019;t hope to survive. So Mitchell demanded of Grammont, likely by pulling up alongside his ship and shouting, that Bannister be arrested and turned over for serving under a foreign commission. It shouldn&#x2019;t have surprised him that Grammont and the other French pirates refused to give over Bannister to the <i>Ruby</i>. That kind of flouting of English authority must have rankled an accomplished navy captain like Mitchell, but he deemed it prudent &#x201c;not to insist further.&#x201d;<br><br> Three months later, in July 1685, Grammont helped lead a historic pirate raid on the Mexican port city of Campeche, in which a landing force of seven hundred pirates sacked the town, took prisoners, and burned the city before leaving with their plunder. It is possible, perhaps even likely, that Bannister and his crew were among those invading pirates, as he was in Grammont&#x2019;s company in the months leading up to the raid. But no one knows for sure.<br><br> Later that year, the <i>Golden Fleece </i>was spotted sailing alone off the western coast of Jamaica. This time, Molesworth sent two ships after Bannister, but neither could find him. Every month, Bannister took more prizes and, with quick footwork and deft escapes, continued to blacken the eyes of Molesworth, the Royal Navy, and England. By January 1686, Molesworth seemed to be losing hope. &#x201c;Captain Mitch- ell will receive orders . . . for the arrest of Bannister,&#x201d; he wrote to an official in London, &#x201c;whom he is as likely to encounter on this voyage as on any other.&#x201d; Meaning he was not likely to find him at all.<br><br> Still, Molesworth continued to plan for the day, however unlikely, that he would lay his hands on Bannister. Rather than allow him to bribe another witness or go free on bond, he would bring him to trial &#x201c;very suddenly,&#x201d; and not at Port Royal but at a court outside the town, with a jury &#x201c;more sensible of the damage we suffer by privateering than are the generality of people in Port Royal.&#x201d;<br> By May, Molesworth might have abandoned all hope of capturing Bannister, but it was in that month that two vessels arrived at Port Royal from Dublin with a report from their captains that Bannister had plundered their cargos. That news should have hardly surprised Molesworth, but a last bit of information stood him up in his seat. Bannister, the men said, was headed to Saman� Bay to careen&#x2014;a process that could take weeks and would immobilize his ship. Molesworth is- sued an order to two of the navy&#x2019;s powerful warships, the <i>Falcon </i>and the <i>Drake</i>. Their mission: find and destroy Bannister.<br><br> At Molesworth&#x2019;s order, the two frigates sailed for Saman� Bay. The <i>Falcon, </i>commanded by Captain Charles Talbot, could carry up to forty-two guns; the <i>Drake, </i>helmed by Captain Thomas Spragge, sixteen.<br><br> They arrived several days later and found Bannister ...</p><h2>Advanced Yoga Practices - Easy Lessons for Ecstatic Living</h2><p>FROM THE BACK COVER OF THE PAPERBACK EDITION:&nbsp;<br>The premise of Yoga is simple.

Handy: The Life and Times of the Man Who Made the Blues</h2><p>Before there was Elvis, there was W.C. Handy, &#x201c;the man who made the blues.&#x201d; Here is the first major biography in decades of the man who gave us such iconic songs as &#x201c;St. Louis Blues,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Memphis Blues,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Beale Street Blues,&#x201d; and who was responsible, more than any other musician, for bringing the blues into the American mainstream.<br><br>David Robertson charts W.C. Handy&#x2019;s rise from a rural Alabama childhood in the last decades of the nineteenth century to become one of the most celebrated songwriters of the twentieth. The child of former slaves, Handy was first inspired by spirituals and folk songs, and his passion for music pushed him to leave home as a teenager, despite opposition from his preacher father. He soon found his way to St. Louis, where he spent a winter sleeping on cobblestone docks before lucking into a job with an Indiana brass band. It was in a minstrel show, playing to racially mixed audiences across the country, that he got his first real exposure as a professional musician, but it was in Memphis, where he settled in 1905, that he hit his full stride as a composer. There, Handy frequented the famous saloons and music halls of Beale Street and composed his legendary songs. By the time of his death in 1958, at the age of eighty-five, he had become a major influence on pop culture, his music recorded by countless musicians, from Bessie Smith to Django Reinhardt.<br><br>Robertson weaves a rich tapestry of the worlds Handy inhabited: the post-Reconstruction South; the ministrel shows in all their racial ambiguity; the mysterious, forbidding Mississippi Delta; Memphis, with its jumping music scene; and New York&#x2019;s Tin Pan Alley. At once a testament to the power of song and a chronicle of race and black music in America, W.C. Handy&#x2019;s life story is in many ways the story of the birth of our country's indigenous culture&#x2014;and a riveting must-read for anyone interested in the history of American music.</p><p>David Robertson is the author of three previous biographies, of the slave rebel Denmark Vesey, the former U.S. secretary of state James F. Byrnes, and the bishop James A. Pike, and of a historical novel about John Wilkes Booth. His poetry has appeared in the <i>Sewanee Review</i> and other journals, and he has provided political and literary commentary to ABC News and <i>The Washington Post.</i> He was educated in Alabama and lives in Ohio.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Dennis Drabelle W.C. Handy didn't live in St. Louis for long, but the period stayed with him because he was so poor that he sometimes had to sleep on cobblestone levees along the Mississippi River. This was in winter, hence the haunting first line of his most famous song: "I hate to see that evening sun go down." Handy later moved to Memphis, where in addition to "St. Louis Blues," he composed "Beale Street Blues," "Yellow Dog Blues" and many other songs that became hits in versions by such great musicians as Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong. According to biographer David Roberts, the young Handy had intended to be "the colored Sousa": a counterpart to the renowned composer of marches. But when Handy heard what we now know of as Mississippi Delta Blues, he changed his mind. "I saw the beauty of primitive music," he recalled. "Their music wanted polishing, but it contained the essence. Folks would pay good money for it." In giving the blues sophistication, Handy made the genre part of "mainstream American music" -- and made himself a rich man. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

As boys, Wilbur and Orville Wright loved making their helicopter fly. As adults, the brothers made their living taking things apart and putting them together again: printing presses, bicycles, planes. . . . Through trial and error, these two boys from Dayton, Ohio, built the plane that would change the world forever.<br>With an inspiring text, original paintings, period photographs, and detailed diagrams, <i>First to Fly</i> recreates the story of the Wright Brothers, from their earliest challenges to their final triumph.</p><p><b>Peter Busby,</b> author of two novels, is a former teacher.<br><b>David Craig&#x2019;s</b> paintings have illustrated many books, posters, plates, and coins.Grade 4-8-This oversized volume captures the Wright brothers' monumental achievement 100 years ago. The pages are filled with large, sumptuous paintings that add a flavor of realism and an almost nostalgic feel. In addition, well-chosen images and reproductions help to inform the text. Archival photos from the Wright brothers' own collection and diagrams created by a mechanical engineer/aeronautics expert do much to help readers understand the concepts of flight. The story of these inventive siblings has been told before and often. This book engages readers quickly and maintains interest throughout. On the morning of December 17, 1903, Orville flew 852 feet and for 59 seconds in the first ever manned and powered flight. While some accounts stop with this achievement, Busby goes on to describe other flights and the company the Wrights founded supplying licensing designs for airplane manufacturers. The stress of watching those patents, the author speculates, may have contributed to Wilbur's ill health and early death at age 45. Orville, working alone, went on to research and experiment, lending insights into developing the automatic pilot and wing flaps for bombers and the space shuttle. This well-researched and exceptionally appealing title joins Wendie Old's To Fly (Clarion, 2002) and Mary Collins's Airborne (National Geographic, 2003) to kick off the centennial celebration.

While many books are available on &#34;spiritual formation&#34; and &#34;Christian disciplines,&#34; no other author of our time has offered such a holistic and comprehensive explanation of Christian formation and its relationship to the human spirituality of all persons. Understanding our Story culls the most seminal ideas and vocabulary from van Kaam&#39;s eleven volumes on formation science, formation anthropology, and formation theology, and provides examples of his theoretical-practical research drawn from everyday life, Scripture, Christian writers, and van Kaam&#39;s life story itself. In doing so, it makes his extensive work available to scholars in the field of spiritual formation, and gives all readers the opportunity to utilize his insightful thinking to more fully understand the myriad ways in which God reforms and transforms lives into the image of Christ. In the pluritraditional world in which we live, where so many faith and formation traditions demand our attention, van Kaam&#39;s formative spirituality provides a means of respectful dialogue with formationally relevant truths from others and of wise appraisal of ideas that are (and are not) conducive to, and compatible with, the Christian revelation.</p><p>Rebecca Letterman, PhD, is Associate Professor of Spiritual Formation at Northeastern Seminary in Rochester, New York, and is a frequent retreat leader for churches and various organizations in the Upstate New York region.

Little do the Darcys realize that gypsies roam these woods, or that both their possessions and the woman are about to vanish into the night. The Darcys seek out the parish magistrate, who is having a difficult evening of his own. Mr. Knightley and his new wife, the former Miss Emma Woodhouse (the heroine of Jane Austen&#39;s Emma) are hosting a party to celebrate the marriage of their friends, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Jane Fairfax. During dinner, Mr. Edgar Churchill, uncle and adoptive father of the groom, falls suddenly ill and dies. The cause of death: poison. When the Darcys and the Knightleys join forces to investigate the crimes, they discover that the robbery and Edgar Churchill&#39;s death may be connected.

Her father had just retired for the night, leaving the newlyweds to enjoy an hour of peace before retiring themselves. Emma&#x2019;s mind, however, was any�thing but quiet as she dwelled upon the discussion she had overheard that morning, and neither the familiar comforts of the&nbsp; room&#x2014; the Chip�pendale sofa and side chairs, the portrait of her late mother above the great&nbsp; hearth&#x2014; nor the novelty of her bridegroom&#x2019;s&nbsp; now- permanent presence there, could quell her agitation. <br>&#x201c;That is what comes of eavesdropping,&#x201d; Mr. Knightley said. <br>&#x201c;I was not eavesdropping,&#x201d; Emma insisted. &#x201c;I was tying my&nbsp; bootlace.&#x201d; <br>The lace had come undone as she left the home of Miss Bates, a middle- aged spinster who lived with her el der ly mother in reduced circumstances on the upper .oor of a modest&nbsp; house. Emma had visited their rooms many times (though perhaps not so often as she ought). Never before, however, had the humble apartment felt so small. The Eltons had called so shortly after Emma&#x2019;s own arrival that it was some time before she could with propriety effect an escape. &#x201c;I paused at the base of the stairs to .x the lace. Could I help it that the Eltons emerged from the apartment and began their discussion on the land�ing before I had done?&#x201d; <br>Mr. Knightley&#x2019;s expression suggested that she might have secured the half- boot more rapidly had she wanted to. Sixteen years her se n�ior, he had known Emma her&nbsp; whole life, and was as well acquainted with her foibles as he was with her charms. His dark eyes narrowed in doubt, and for a moment she dreaded an admonition delivered in his usual forthright manner. Instead, he&nbsp; rose and stirred. The flickering light shadowed his countenance and silhouetted his tall frame. Though he possessed the maturity and bearing of a man&nbsp; eight-and- thirty, he had maintained the .rm .gure of younger days, and Emma congratulated herself on having found such a&nbsp; .ne- looking husband once she had .nally opened her eyes to the gentleman next door. <br>He returned the poker to its stand and adjusted the screen to shield them from the heat. &#x201c;It is fortunate that you managed to exit without the Eltons&#x2019; seeing you in the stairwell.&#x201d; He sat down beside her on the sofa. &#x201c;To have been caught listening to their conversation, however involuntarily, would not have re.ected well on you.&#x201d; <br>The last position in which Emma would want to .nd herself was that of giving Augusta Elton any room to expand her already in.ated sense of superiority. Mrs. Elton&#x2019;s greatest claim to society was a&nbsp; brother-in- law who owned a&nbsp; barouche- landau and an estate near Bristol. Though the&nbsp; house was named Maple Grove, Mrs. Elton seemed to think it was St. James&#x2019;s Palace. She also took extraordinary pride in her status as the vicar&#x2019;s wife, performing her role with pretensions of elegance and a pronounced air of noblesse oblige. Sadly, Mr. Elton, though a clergyman, was nearly as vain and insufferable as she. <br>&#x201c;It is still more fortunate that I did overhear them, for now I can rescue poor Miss Bates from their plotting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Emma&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Honestly, you should have heard them! Talking about how Miss Bates will surely become dependent upon parish charity after her mother dies.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I doubt that will happen, with her niece marrying Frank Churchill next week. A gentleman who stands to inherit an estate the size of Enscombe will not forsake his wife&#x2019;s aunt.&#x201d; <br>Emma knew that Mr. Knightley spoke not from conviction of Frank Churchill&#x2019;s reliability, but from his own principles: Because Mr. Knightley would never neglect a needy relation, he expected all gentlemen to demonstrate the same sense of duty. In fact, he had for�feited his own inde pendence to act rightly by Emma&#x2019;s father. Upon their marriage, Mr. Knightley had graciously moved into the&nbsp; house of Emma&#x2019;s birth so that she need not abandon the invalid Mr. Wood-house or subject the old man to the trauma of leaving his lifelong home to live with them at Mr. Knightley&#x2019;s more sizable estate, Don-well Abbey. &nbsp;Though the distance was&nbsp; slight&#x2014; Hart.eld bordered Mr. Knightley&#x2019;s&nbsp; grounds&#x2014; Mr. Wood house suffered from a nervous disposition and did not bear well change of any sort. The living arrangement left Donwell Abbey without its master in residence, and Emma appreciated the sacri.ce her husband had made on behalf of herself and her father. <br>The vicar and his wife, however,&nbsp; were entirely capable of more sel.sh conduct, and therefore anticipated it in others. &#x201c;The Eltons are convinced that once Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax wed and move so far away as Yorkshire, the Bates ladies will be forgotten,&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;Mrs. Elton is determined to make certain that Miss Bates be�comes someone else&#x2019;s responsibility and not the parish&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>To be speci.c, Mrs. Elton had proposed marrying off Miss Bates to any man&#x2014; gentleman or&nbsp; not&#x2014; who would have her. Granted, .nding a husband for a woman of forty- odd years would prove a daunting enterprise, and Miss Bates&#x2019;s situation was further challenged by the spinster&#x2019;s propensity for endless chatter. Emma herself found Miss Bates&#x2019;s trivial tidings and cheerful effusions tedious; she could scarcely imagine a husband willing to endure them day and night. <br>Mrs. Elton, however, had gone so far as to suggest an addlepated local farmer as the ideal candidate, and declared to Mr. Elton her intention of arranging the match. In that, the vicar&#x2019;s wife had gone too far. <br>&#x201c;She cannot be permitted to proceed,&#x201d; Emma continued. &#x201c;Not when I have the ability to arrange a superior establishment for Miss Bates.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You told me, Emma, after Harriet Smith married Robert Martin despite your interference, that you had given up matchmaking.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This is not matchmaking. It is&#x2014;&#x201d; She considered her words care�fully, for there was no bluf.ng her husband. Mr. Knightley knew her better than did any other soul on earth. &#x201c;It is merely taking advantage of an opportunity.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;An opportunity to meddle.&#x201d; <br>Now Emma found herself vexed not only at the Eltons, but at her &#x201c;dear Mr. Knightley.&#x201d; This latest was a slight&nbsp; vexation&#x2014; a tri.e, really. Well, perhaps more than a tri.e. But it was her husband&#x2019;s fault for willfully misinterpreting her motives for the scheme she had spent all afternoon contemplating. <br>&#x201c;An opportunity to show kindness towards someone to whom you yourself have said I ought to demonstrate greater generosity. You should be pleased that I have taken to heart your reproofs regarding my lack of consideration for Miss Bates, and that I wish to make amends for my previous neglect. Her situation is indeed pitiable. She has sacri.ced half her life to the care of her&nbsp; near- deaf mother. Is she to spend her old age either alone in poverty, or with some&nbsp; half- wit imposed upon her by Mrs. Elton?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We can guard Miss Bates from any maneuverings Mrs. Elton might undertake without your trying to orchestrate a match of your own.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can we? Miss Bates is so appreciative of any attention or kindness shown her that even if she had reservations about the groom, she would wed him simply out of gratitude, or in deference to Mrs. Elton for arranging the marriage. If Miss Bates ever possessed enough quick�ness of mind to recognize an unfavorable situation when presented with one, years of deprivation have surely worn down her ability to resist it.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Knightley could remember Miss Bates at a more carefree pe�riod of her&nbsp; life&#x2014; before her father, a former vicar of Highbury, had died. As a clergyman&#x2019;s bene.ce made no provisions for surviving de�pendents, Mr. Bates&#x2019;s widow and daughter had been left to shift as best they could on an income insuf.cient to support even one of them, let alone two, in moderate comfort. The pair, however, being of naturally content temperaments and possessing enough sense to live within their means, accepted their situation with grace, and made the best of it. <br>&#x201c;Miss Bates never exhibited your cleverness, Emma, nor even an intellect as strong as her younger sister&#x2019;s. Yet you will not meet a kinder- hearted soul in all Surrey. Leave her in peace.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Her good heart is precisely why I wish to perform a kindness for her in turn. You would merely save her from the evils of Mrs. Elton, whereas I hope to secure her a future happier than her present. Somewhere in England there must be a&nbsp; gentleman&#x2014; a good, decent gentleman, not merely the .rst unmarried commoner Mrs. Elton can manipulate&#x2014; who can appreciate Miss Bates.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It would not be a kindness to introduce hopes that Miss Bates must have set aside long ago, only to have them once more disappointed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why do you assume they will be disappointed? She need not captivate the entire Polite World, merely a single man.&#x201d; Ideally, one in possession of a good fortune. &#x201c;And the celebration of her niece&#x2019;s marriage to Frank Churchill will bring more new gentlemen to High-bury than I daresay this village has ever seen at once.&#x201d; <br>Though the wedding would take place in London, where the bride had been raised, Frank and Jane would visit the village before remov�ing to the Churchill estate in Yorkshire. What had initially been con�ceived as a small dinner party to receive the postnuptial&nbsp; well- wishes of their Highbury friends had burgeoned into an elaborate affair once Mr. Weston, Frank&#x2019;s father, began issuing invitations. Not only was every respectable family in the neighborhood to attend, but auld acquaintance must not be forgot. &nbsp;Because Randalls, the Westons&#x2019; home, had but two spare bedrooms and the Crown Inn could not accom�modate everybody, Donwell Abbey would host the affair and lodge many of the&nbsp; out- of- town guests. <br>The venue had been Emma&#x2019;s idea, motivated by her friendship with Mrs. Weston, Frank&#x2019;s stepmother. Though Mr. Knightley acqui�esced, he was not without uneasiness over the thought of visitors&#x2014; many of them&nbsp; strangers&#x2014; occupying his&nbsp; house in his absence. He and Emma, therefore, would stay at Donwell while Emma&#x2019;s visiting sister and her family stayed with Mr. Wood house. Emma credited their newlywed status for her successful application on this point, for under few other circumstances could she imagine Mr. Knightley&#x2019;s be�ing persuaded to go so out of his way regarding an event that honored Frank Churchill. Mr. Knightley thought the young man&nbsp; self- centered and more fortunate in his&nbsp; relationships&#x2014; especially his betrothal to Jane Fairfax&#x2014; than he deserved. <br>His unexpected role as a host did, however, enable Mr. Knightley to perform a service for the Bates ladies. He proposed that Mrs. and Miss Bates also consider themselves sponsors of the gathering. Through his means, they would be able to give Jane a proper&nbsp; send- off. <br>&#x201c;This affair has already grown to answer more purposes than any�one originally intended,&#x201d; Mr. Knightley said. &#x201c;Now it is to serve as a promenade of suitors for your appraisal?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is that not a tacit component of most social events? The differ�ence is that this time, no one&#x2014; including the lady&nbsp; herself&#x2014; will know that this gathering is, of sorts, a&nbsp; coming- out ball. I shall be entirely discreet in my evaluations.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I do not think this wise. Even did I not harbor reservations about the presumption of attempting to .nd a husband for Miss Bates, one cannot learn much of use about a gentleman at a dinner party.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I disagree.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And should a man whom you judge suitable present himself, what course of action do you intend to pursue in consequence?&#x201d; <br>Emma had not yet settled her mind as to that part of her plan. For the present, merely .nding a worthy object was challenge enough. &nbsp;Excerpted from The Intrigue At Highbury by Carrie Bebris.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Carrie Bebris.<br>Published in March 2010 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC.<br>All rights reserved.

To reach it, you'll have to set your clock back to the end of the nineteenth century, when an Act of Congress allowed Americans to mail a card for just one cent. A few years later, Kodak introduced an easy-to-use and affordable folding camera that put postcard power into the hands of ordinary citizens, setting off a craze. <em>Real Photo Postcards</em> is a collection of the most outlandish and idiosyncratic, beautiful and even occasionally bizarre images of this early postcard period.<br><br>Painstakingly assembled from the collection of Harvey Tulcensky, one of the world's most avid collectors of these original postcards, <em>Real Photo Postcards</em> includes images of natural phenomena (floods, storms, fires), Main Street America, rural life, political parades, and wacky "exaggeration" cards (such as a photographically manipulated giant rabbit!).

In 1907 the U.S. Postal Service made an abrupt reversal of a law forbidding messages from being written on the backs of postcards. This change, coinciding with Kodak's introduction of an affordable, easy-to-use portable camera that printed out photographs onto heavy card stock, inspired a flurry of homespun postcards akin to the current digital photography craze. Because the photos were one-of-a-kind snapshots, produced predominantly by ordinary folks whose goal was to send a frozen moment, a fond wish or just a giggle to a friend or loved one, they tend toward an authenticity and an idiosyncrasy often lacking in more professional photographs of the day. These "real photo postcards" come from the extensive collection of artist Tulcensky; editor Wolff captions the photos with observations or notes from their backs, but mostly just lets these remarkable images speak for themselves. Organized into categories like "Parading," "Romance," "Disasters" and "Uncanny," this volume offers a unique glimpse of the early 20th century through the eyes of the everyman. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Reprint.</p><p>On the night of February 17, 1869, the Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleyev went to bed frustrated by a puzzle he had been playing with for years: how the atomic weights of the chemical elements could be grouped in some meaningful way--and one that, with any luck, would open a window onto the hidden structure of nature. He dreamed, as he later recalled, of "a table where all the elements fell into place as required." His intuition that when the elements were listed in order of weight, their properties repeated in regular intervals, gave rise to the Periodic Table of the Elements--which, though much revised since, underlies modern chemistry. <p> Mendeleyev's discovery brackets Paul Strathern's learned and literate history of chemistry. He traces the origins of that science, as it is understood in the West, to the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, who backed up his surmises about the nature of things with evidence and used arguments "entirely within the realm of this world." From Thales's day, Strathern takes us into the studies of Arabic-speaking scientists such as Avicenna and Al-Razi, who preserved classical science and added to it their own insights; introduces us to the medieval alchemists who in turn preserved the work of Islamic scholars while questing to discover the inner secrets of matter (and perhaps make a little gold in the bargain); and leads us into the early modern world of such greats as Lavoisier, Van Helmont, and Cavendish, who added rigorous methodology and important discoveries to that quest.</p> <p> Strathern relates false steps and true breakthroughs alike, and his narrative is a pleasure to read. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Paul Strathern was born in London in 1940 and studied physics, chemistry and math at Trinity College, Dublin, before switching to philosophy.

In this account of what it was like to grow up a White Sox fan in a Cubs nation, Roeper covers the recent history of the organization, from the heartbreak of 1967&nbsp;and the South-Side Hit Men to the disco demolition and the magical 2005 season when they became world champions. Encapsulating what it means to be a baseball fan, root for the same sorry team no matter what, and find vindication,&nbsp;this history of the White Sox is flavored with trivia; anecdotes about players, owners, and broadcasters; plus Roeper&#x2019;s own humorous and personal reminiscences.</p></p><p><b>Richard Roeper</b> is the author of <i>Hollywood Urban Legends, Schlock Value, Ten Sure Signs a Movie Character Is Doomed,</i> and <i>Urban Legends. </i>He is a columnist for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times </i>and a cohost of&nbsp;<i>Ebert &amp; Roeper</i>.Roeper's mother was nine months pregnant with him when the Chicago White Sox made their losing stand at the 1959 World Series, beginning a post-season drought that wouldn't end until their championship 2005 season. Roeper, a Chicago Sun-Times columnist and co-host of Ebert &amp; Roeper, grew up an impenetrable and sometimes irritable Sox fan. Here, he examines the history and culture of Chicago's second baseball team, and his personal history as a fan, with the kind of devotion usually reserved for family memoirs. He claims to have attended a thousand Sox games, and he adamantly argues why the South Side team will always be superior to the North Side Cubs. Naturally, Roeper (Schlock Value) peppers his narrative with movie references, as well as fun sidebars and details about long-forgotten games and players. His irreverent style-alternately witty and abrasive-recalls Chuck Klosterman's essays on pop culture and music, and his take on such subjects as the old Comiskey Park and the joys of owning season tickets for a losing team are detailed, funny and quick. Sox fans will love this one, Cubs fans will mock it and the unaffiliated will better understand what it means to be a true baseball fan. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Of importance to architects, folklorists, cultural historians, and anyone interested in the Ozarks, this fascinating examination of the Ozark house is a way toward understanding the mind of the inhabitants and their entire way of life.</p><p>A significant regional work, Ozark Vernacular Houses focuses on building forms and their relationship to the transmission of cultural ideas. It offers a microcosmic view of how the unwritten, tradition-based methods of house building in Washington and Stone counties in northwest Arkansas were emblematic of the whole region. Far from being the haphazard houses of popular imagination, Ozark houses were based on a few archetypal plans that were carried in the minds of generations of Ozark craftsmen. Over 160 photographs, drawings, and maps provide examples of the four traditional house types - the single pen, the double pen, the dogtrot, and the I-house - and reveal the unity of a distinctive culture in the Arkansas Ozarks. Sizemore&#39;s interpretive analysis is not limited to architectural forms. She examines both the inner and outer spaces of the Ozark house. Included in Sizemore&#39;s study are the material objects its owners possessed, the way the areas within the house were arranged, the structure within the house, as well as the landscape that formed the backdrop for the house, the yard arrangement, and the barns and outbuildings. Of importance to architects, folklorists, cultural historians, and anyone interested in the Ozarks, this fascinating examination of the Ozark house is a way toward understanding the mind of the inhabitants and their way of life.Jean Sizemore is associate professor of art history at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock.</p><h2>World According to Garp</h2><p>The World According to Garp is a comic and compassionate coming-of-age novel that established John Irving as one of the most imaginative writers of his generation. A worldwide bestseller since its publication in 1978, Irving&#39;s classic is filled with stories inside stories about the life and times of T. S. Garp, novelist and bastard son of Jenny Fields - a feminist leader ahead of her time. Beyond that, The World According to Garp virtually defies synopsis.</p><p>"Garp was a natural storyteller," says the narrator of John Irving's incandescent novel, referring to the book's hero, the novelist Garp, who has much in common with Irving himself. "He could make things up one right after the other, and they seemed to fit."<p> Irving packs wild characters and weird events into his classic--officially recognized as such in a Modern Library edition with a new introduction by the author--while amazingly maintaining the rough feel of realism in every scene and the pulse of life in every heart. Many novelists of his time might have populated a novel with a novelist protagonist whose life and books comment on each other and the novel we're reading. Transsexual football players, ball turret gunners lobotomized in battle, multiple adultery, unicycling bears, mad feminists who amputate their tongues in sympathy with the celebrated victim of a horrifying rape--Irving made them all people. Even the bear is a fitting character. </p><p> In a crucial episode, Garp's wife's seduction of a young man coincidentally occurs at the moment when Garp is delighting their young sons with a reckless car trick (one of the few scenes beautifully, eerily, heartbreakingly captured in the film version as well). Many authors would have been content with the harsh comedy of the scene, but Irving respects its integrity, and he builds the rest of the book on the consequences of the event. How does he get away with his killer cocktail of slapstick and horror? Because it's simply what we all face daily, rearranged into soul-satisfying art. "Life is an X-rated soap opera," according to Garp, and who can contradict him?</p><p> Rereading <i>Garp</i> 20 years later, one is struck by how elegantly Irving structures his bizarre and complex story. Take the two most celebrated bits in the book, the Under Toad and Garp's story "<i>The Pension Grillparzer,</i>" which shimmers like an exquisite Kafkaesque insect in the amber of the novel. When Garp warns his son about the "undertow" at the beach, the boy imagines a monster out of <i>Beowulf</i> who lurks beneath the waves to suck you under: the "Under Toad." It's funny at first, but we soon find that the Under Toad is a metaphor with teeth--he connects with a prophetic dream of death in "The Pension Grillparzer," set in Vienna. Garp's son's last words are, "It's like a dream!" And as Irving--who studied at the University of Vienna--can certainly tell you, the German word for "death" sounds precisely like the English word "toad."</p><p> All that death, and yet Garp is mainly exuberant. This story is, as Garp's stuttering writing teacher puts it, "rich with lu-lu-lunacy and sorrow." It enriches literature, and our lives. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>To be honest, I never read John Irving before I read A Widow For One Year. But after I finished Widow, I went on a John Irving reading frenzy. I read A Prayer for Owen Meany, The 158 Pound Marriage, The Water-Method Man, and The Cider House Rules.<br><br>Then I fell in love with Garp.<br><br>When John Irving agreed to read the new introduction to The World According to Garp for our new Unabridged AudioBook, we were thrilled. He would record in New York, on a Wednesday morning, but needed a ride to the studio. Could anyone give him a lift?<br><br>Please. I jumped at the chance.<br><br>As we talked about Garp and the pending publication of A Widow for One Year, I suddenly realized I've been sitting in New York City traffic for the last 30 minutes with John Irving. Sure, he's one of the greatest American writers today, but he's also one of the nicest people I've ever been stuck in traffic with. <br> -Carrie, Random House AudioBooks Publicity</p><h2>The Second American Revolution</h2><p>The authors show how public solutions to current issues differ from political practices</p><p>James Patterson is Chairman of J.

Walter Thompson and best-selling author of <i>Along Came a Spider</i> (1992); Kim, vice chairman of McCann-Erickson Worldwide--will tell us what the American people <i>really</i> want. The authors' previous survey-and-focus-group concoction, <i>The Day America Told the Truth</i> (1991), was more scattershot; here, they focus on leadership and public policy issues with the tools their agencies would use to test the appeal of a new soft drink: simulations of local and national town halls and national referenda--and an executive search firm to spot potential "leaders." (Media attention is likely here: the search firm reduced the field from nearly 1,000 to 90 to 18 candidates; 1,067 respondents to a survey (sent to 3,000) chose a "winner," to be announced when the book is published.) Since "he who asks the questions determines the answers," attentive readers will be disturbed by the narrowness of the authors' sources on critical issues and by the na&#x2039;vet&#x201a; of their "optimism" about aspects of "the People's Agenda."

The senator is Cicero, a brilliant young lawyer and spellbinding orator, determined to attain <i>imperium</i> - supreme power in the state.</p> <p>This is the starting-point of Robert Harris's most accomplished novel to date. Compellingly written in Tiro's voice, it takes us inside the violent, treacherous world of Roman politics, to describe how one man - clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable - fought to reach the top.</p> <p> <b>'Sometimes it is foolish to articulate an ambition too early - exposing it prematurely to the laughter and scepticism of the world can destroy it before it is even properly born. But sometimes the opposite occurs, and the very act of mentioning a thing makes it suddenly seem possible, even plausible. That was how it was that night. When Cicero pronounced the word "consul" he planted it in the ground like a standard for us all to admire. And for a moment we glimpsed the brilliant, starry future through his eyes, and saw that he was right: that if he took down Verres, he had a chance; that he might - just - with luck - go all the way to the summit...'</b> </p></p><p><b>Robert Harris</b> was born in Nottingham in 1957. He has been a BBC journalist, Political Editor of the <i>Observer</i>, and a columnist for <i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. In 2003 he was named Columnist of the Year in the British Press Awards. He is the author of the number one bestsellers <b>Fatherland</b>, <b>Enigma</b>, <b>Archangel</b> and <b>Pompeii</b> as well as five non-fiction books.<p> </p><p> It had been my intention to describe in detail the trial of Gaius Verres, but now I come to set it down, I see there is no point. After Cicero's tactical masterstroke on that first day, Verres and his advocates resembled nothing so much as the victims of a siege: holed up in their little fortress, surrounded by their enemies, battered day after day by a rain of missiles, and their crumbling walls undermined by tunnels. They had no means of fighting back. Their only hope was somehow to withstand the onslaught for the nine days remaining, and then try to regroup during the lull enforced by Pompey's games. Cicero's objective was equally clear: to obliterate Verres's defenses so completely that by the time he had finished laying out his case, not even the most corrupt senatorial jury in Rome would dare to acquit him. </p><p> He set about this mission with his usual discipline. The prosecution team would gather before dawn. While Cicero performed his exercises, was shaved and dressed, I would read out the testimony of the witnesses he would be calling that day and run through our schedule of evidence. He would then dictate to me the rough outline of what he intended to say. For an hour or two he would familiarize himself with the day's brief and thoroughly memorize his remarks, while Quintus, Frugi, and I ensured that all his witnesses and evidence boxes were ready. We would then parade down the hill to the Forum -- and parades they were, for the general view around Rome was that Cicero's performance in the extortion court was the greatest show in town. The crowds were as large on the second and third days as they had been on the first, and the witnesses' performances were often heartbreaking, as they collapsed in tears recounting their ill treatment. I remember in particular Dio of Halaesa, swindled out of ten thousand sesterces, and two brothers from Agyrium forced to hand over their entire inheritance of four thousand. There would have been more, but Lucius Metellus had actually refused to let a dozen witnesses leave the island to testify, among them the chief priest of Jupiter, Heraclius of Syracuse -- an outrage against justice which Cicero neatly turned to his advantage. "Our allies' rights," he boomed, "do not even include permission to complain of their sufferings!" Throughout all this, Hortensius, amazing to relate, never said a word. Cicero would finish his examination of a witness, Glabrio would offer the King of the Law Courts his chance to cross-examine, and His Majesty would regally shake his head, or declare grandly, "No questions for this witness." On the fourth day, Verres pleaded illness and tried to be excused from attending, but Glabrio was having none of it, and told him he would be carried down to the Forum on his bed if necessary. </p><p> It was on the following afternoon that Cicero's cousin Lucius at last returned to Rome, his mission in Sicily accomplished. Cicero was overjoyed to find him waiting at the house when we got back from court, and he embraced him tearfully. Without Lucius's support in dispatching witnesses and boxes of evidence back to the mainland, Cicero's case would not have been half as strong. But the seven-month effort had clearly exhausted Lucius, who had not been a strong man to begin with. He was now alarmingly thin and had developed a painful, racking cough. Even so, his commitment to bringing Verres to justice was unwavering -- so much so that he had missed the opening of the trial in order to take a detour on his journey back to Rome. He had stayed in Puteoli and tracked down two more witnesses: the Roman knight, Gaius Numitorius, who had witnessed the crucifixion of Gavius in Messana; and a friend of his, a merchant named Marcus Annius, who had been in Syracuse when the Roman banker Herennius had been judicially murdered. </p><p> "And where are these gentlemen?" asked Cicero eagerly. </p><p> "Here," replied Lucius. "In the tablinum. But I must warn you, they do not want to testify." </p><p> Cicero hurried through to find two formidable men of middle age -- "the perfect witnesses from my point of view," as Cicero afterwards described them, "prosperous, respectable, sober, and above all -- not Sicilian." As Lucius had predicted, they were reluctant to get involved. They were businessmen, with no desire to make powerful enemies, and did not relish the prospect of taking starring roles in Cicero's great anti-aristocratic production in the Roman Forum. But he wore them down, for they were not fools, either, and could see that in the ledger of profit and loss, they stood to gain most by aligning themselves with the side that was winning. "Do you remember what Pompey said to Sulla, when the old man tried to deny him a triumph on his twenty-sixth birthday?" asked Cicero. "He told me over dinner the other night: 'More people worship a rising than a setting sun.'" This potent combination of name-dropping and appeals to patriotism and self-interest at last brought them around, and by the time they went in to dinner with Cicero and his family they had pledged their support. </p><p> "I knew if I had them in your company for a few moments," whispered Lucius, "they would do whatever you wanted." </p><p> I had expected Cicero to put them on the witness stand the very next day, but he was too smart for that. "A show must always end with a climax," he said. He was ratcheting up the level of outrage with each new piece of evidence, having moved on through judicial corruption, extortion, and straightforward robbery to cruel and unusual punishment. On the eighth day of the trial, he dealt with the testimony of two Sicilian naval captains, Phalacrus of Centuripae and Onasus of Segesta, who described how they and their men had escaped floggings and executions by bribing Verres's freedman Timarchides (present in court, I am glad to say, to experience his humiliation personally). Worse: the families of those who had not been able to raise sufficient funds to secure the release of their relatives had been told they would still have to pay a bribe to the official executioner, Sextius, or he would deliberately make a mess of the beheadings. "Think of that unbearable burden of pain," declaimed Cicero, "of the anguish that racked those unhappy parents, thus compelled to purchase for their children by bribery not life but a speedy death!" I could see the senators on the jury shaking their heads at this and muttering to one another, and each time Glabrio invited Hortensius to cross-examine the witnesses, and Hortensius simply responded yet again, "No questions," they groaned. Their position was becoming intolerable, and that night the first rumors reached us that Verres had already packed up the contents of his house and was preparing to flee into exile. </p><p> Such was the state of affairs on the ninth day, when we brought Annius and Numitorius into court. If anything, the crowd in the Forum was bigger than ever, for there were now only two days left until Pompey's great games. Verres came late and obviously drunk. He stumbled as he climbed the steps of the temple up to the tribunal, and Hortensius had to steady him as the crowd roared with laughter. As he passed Cicero's place, he flashed him a shattered, red-eyed look of fear and rage -- the hunted, cornered look of an animal: the Boar at bay. Cicero got straight down to business and called as his first witness Annius, who described how he had been inspecting a cargo down at the harbor in Syracuse one morning when a friend had come running to tell him that their business associate, Herennius, was in chains in the forum and pleading for his life. </p><p> "So what did you do?" </p><p> "Naturally, I went at once." </p><p> "And what was the scene?" </p><p> "There were perhaps a hundred people crying out that Herennius was a Roman citizen and could not be executed without a proper trial." </p><p> "How did you all know that Herennius was a Roman? Was he not a banker from Spain?" </p><p> "Many of us knew him personally. Although he had business in Spain, he had been born to a Roman family in Syracuse and had grown up in the city." </p><p> "And what was Verres's response to your pleas?" </p><p> "He ordered Herennius to be beheaded immediately." </p><p> There was a groan of horror around the court. </p><p> "And who dealt the fatal blow?" </p><p> "The public executioner, Sextius." </p><p> "And did he make a clean job of it?" </p><p> "I am afraid he did not, no." </p><p> "Clearly," said Cicero, turning to the jury, "he had not paid Verres and his gang of thieves a large enough bribe." </p><p> For most of the trial, Verres had sat slumped in his chair, but on this morning, fired by drink, he jumped up and began shouting that he had never taken any such bribe. Hortensius had to pull him down. Cicero ignored him and went on calmly questioning his witness. </p><p> "This is an extraordinary situation, is it not? A hundred of you vouch for the identity of this Roman citizen, yet Verres does not even wait an hour to establish the truth of who he is. How do you account for it?" </p><p> "I can account for it easily, senator. Herennius was a passenger on a ship from Spain that was impounded with all its cargo by Verres's agents. He was sent to the Stone Quarries, along with everyone else on board, then dragged out to be publicly executed as a pirate. What Verres did not realize was that Herennius was not from Spain at all. He was known to the Roman community in Syracuse and would be recognized. But by the time Verres discovered his mistake, Herennius could not be allowed to go free, because he knew too much about what the governor was up to." </p><p> "Forgive me, I do not understand," said Cicero, playing the innocent. "Why would Verres want to execute an innocent passenger on a cargo ship as a pirate?" </p><p> "He needed to show a sufficient number of executions." </p><p> "Why?" </p><p> "Because he was being paid bribes to let the real pirates go free." </p><p> Verres was on his feet again shouting that it was a lie, and this time Cicero took a few paces toward him. "A lie, you monster? A lie? Then why in your own prison records does it state that Herennius was released? And why do they further state that the notorious pirate captain Heracleo was executed, when no one on the ...</p></p><h2>Gordon Ramsay&#39;s Three Star Chef</h2><p>Gordon Ramsay&#x2019;s no-holds-barred television persona has garnered widespread attention both stateside and abroad, but his food continues to be his greatest achievement.

The end result is the fall of several Mafia families and the defection of high-ranking mobsters. Author Rick Porrello is a veteran cop who wrote about his mob roots in &#34;The Rise and Fall of the Cleveland Mafia&#34;. To Kill the Irishman has been optioned for a major motion picture.</p><p>For decades, Americans have had a fascination with the Mafia. We have paid the box offices generously to be entertained by films like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino and Donnie Brasco. Likewise, millions have been spent in bookstores on titles like Boss of Bosses, Doublecross, The Last Mafioso, Underboss and the numerous John Gotti stories. <p>It started in the fifties, when mob soldier Joseph Valachi broke the blood oath of omerta which swears Mafia members to secrecy, violations being punishable by death. The term Mafia became a household word. Higher ranking mob turncoats like Jimmy "Weasel" Fratianno, Angelo "Big Ange" Lonardo and Sammy "the Bull" Gravano would follow. </p><p>In years to come we would learn of the Mafia's influence in labor unions, gambling, political corruption, narcotics, major airports, big city docks, legitimate business and industry and even the entertainment mecca of Las Vegas. With hard-to-ignore evidence, there would be shocking allegations that the Mafia had collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency in "Operation Mongoose," the plot to assassinate Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro. It is even believed by many that the Mafia helped engineer the rise of John F. Kennedy to President of the United States, then was responsible for the assassination of he and his brother Senator Robert Kennedy, and actress Marilyn Monroe. </p><p>In the seventies and eighties, the government began winning more of their battles with the Mafia. New anti-racketeering legislation and technology, coupled with tougher drug laws, undercover operations, unprecedented inter-agency cooperation and WITSEC, the federal witness protection program were effective weapons. Attrition of old-school Mafioso made the timing good. The young replacements were not the jail-stint-hardened men that their fathers, uncles and neighborhood heroes were. As a result of all this, whole Mafia hierarchies were dismantled in cities like Milwaukee, Cleveland, Kansas City and Los Angeles. Top New York mob dons, like Tony Salerno and John Gotti were, convicted and imprisoned for life.</p>A police officer in suburban Cleveland, Lt. Rick Porrello serendipitously began his writing career when curiosity about the mysterious murder of his grandfather and several uncles led to penning his first true-crime saga, The Rise and Fall of the Cleveland Mafia. Porrello went on to write a second book, To Kill the Irishman, which recounts the story of Irish-American racketeer Danny Greene who took on the Cleveland Mafia and was murdered in 1977.</p><h2>People Of The Bomb: Portraits of America&#x2019;s Nuclear Complex</h2><p>We have had the bomb on our minds since 1945.

DoctorowThis book tells the story of how-like it or not, know it or not-we have become &#34;the people of the bomb.&#34; Integrating fifteen years of field research at weapons laboratories across the United States with discussion of popular movies, political speeches, media coverage of war, and the arcane literature of defense intellectuals, Hugh Gusterson shows how the military-industrial complex has built consent for its programs and, in the process, taken the public &#34;nuclear.&#34;People of the Bomb mixes empathic and vivid portraits of individual weapons scientists with hard-hitting scrutiny of defense intellectuals&#39; inability to foresee the end of the cold war, government rhetoric on missile defense, official double standards about nuclear proliferation, and pork barrel politics in the nuclear weapons complex. Overall, the book assembles a disturbing picture of the ways in which the military-industrial complex has transformed our public culture and personal psychology in the half century since we entered the nuclear age.Hugh Gusterson is associate professor of anthropology and science studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and professor of public policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

This North Atlantic region belongs to the sea. The maritime influence on climate, flora, and fauna is dominant even far inland. Both on land and at sea, this region is where north meets south, where the great northern boreal forests intermingle with the southern coniferous-hardwood forests, and where the icy Labrador Current and the tropical Gulf Stream vie for supremacy and eventually mix. <i>The Atlantic Coast</i> draws upon the best and most up-to-date science on the ecology of the region as well as the author&#x2019;s lifetime experience as a resident, biologist, and naturalist.

The Kirtland's warbler is the rarest warbler species in North America and will always be rare because of its persnickety nesting preferences. But when the total population fell below 400 birds in the 1970s and 1980s---driven largely by a loss of habitat and the introduction of a parasite---a small group of dedicated biologists, researchers, and volunteers vowed to save the Kirtland's warbler despite long odds. This is the story of the warbler's survival and gradual recovery, the people and policies that kept it from extinction, and the ongoing challenges that may again jeopardize the bird's future.<br> In <i>The Kirtland's Warbler</i>, William Rapai explores the bird's fascinating natural history as well as the complex and evolving relationships between the warbler, its environment, its human protectors, and state and federal policies that today threaten to eradicate decades of work done on the species' behalf. Beginning with an account of the warbler's discovery in the mid-nineteenth century and ornithologists' desperate hunt for information on the elusive new species, the book goes on to examine the dramatic events that quickly led to the warbler's precarious status and its eventual emergence as a lightning rod for controversy.<br> The Kirtland's warbler is often described as a "bird of fire" for its preference for nesting in areas cleared by wildfire. But it also warrants the name for the passion it ignites in humans. Both tragic and uplifting, the story of this intriguing bird is a stirring example of how strong leadership, vision, commitment, sustained effort, and cooperation can come together to protect our natural world.<br><br><i>The Kirtland's Warbler</i>&nbsp;has been named a Michigan Notable Book for 2013 by the Library of Michigan.</p><p><p><b>William Rapai</b> is president of Grosse Pointe Audubon Society and has traveled across North America and to Cuba, Iceland, and Thailand to view and research birds. He was an award-winning reporter and editor for the <i>Grand Forks Herald</i>, the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>, and the <i>Boston Globe</i>. This is his first book. </p>"Small, rare, and not often seen without a special effort, Kirtland's warbler has still managed to capture the imaginations of countless people. This story of its close brush with extinction and the struggle to pull it back from the brink reads like an adventure novel, except that it's all true."&nbsp;<br>--Kenn Kaufman, Kaufman Field Guides<br><br>"Besides exhaustively recounting the human and natural history of an extraordinary bird, Rapai has crafted a rare combination of easily accessible prose, scientific literacy, and human passion, together with the mystery and drama of endangered species management."&nbsp;<br>--John Fitzpatrick, Director, Cornell Lab of Ornithology<br><br>"The stories and tales surrounding this rare and mysterious species are almost as captivating as the bird itself.

Delsohn is also a correspondent for ESPN television. A native of Chicago, he now lives in Thousand Oaks, California, with his wife and three daughters.Born in 1956 to John Wayne and his third wife, Pilar, the author witnessed the passing of her father from movie star to American icon. Not surprisingly, he was a stern father--harder on his sons than his little girl. Unlike Christina Crawford's book about her mother, Joan, this is no Duke Dearest; Wayne comes off as a fully rounded person, ultimately held in a sympathetic light. There's little here that hasn't already been suggested in many Wayne bios, although the author does contest the claims made by her father's last personal secretary, Pat Stacy, that the two were open lovers.<br><i>- Thomas Wie ner, formerly with "American Film," Washington, D.C.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Children of the River: Growing up with 18 brothers and sisters along the Susquehanna</h2><p><p>Experience a life that few people live today.

Learn more at ArtAtLargeInc.com.Gr 2&#x2013;6&#x2014;In this vividly illustrated picture book, Watkins, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., provides a simplified version of his six guiding principles of nonviolence: have courage; love your enemies; fight the problem, not the person who caused it; when innocent people are hurt, others are inspired to help; resist violence of any kind; and the universe honors love. Referring to King as "Uncle Martin," Watkins states each principle and then describes one clearly written example of how King followed it. Instances selected include the burning of King's home in 1956 and King's famous "Letter from Birmingham Jail," in which he argued for nonviolent resistance. The bold, colorful mixed-media illustrations capture the emotion of the situations described, and Watkins's writing style is conversational but impassioned ("So even when Uncle Martin was hurt, he did not respond with violence."). Though informative, this title lacks back matter. An excellent choice for younger students studying King and for teachers explaining violence in history and current events, as well as for beginning middle school students.&#x2014;Stephanie Farnlacher, Trace Crossings Elementary School, Hoover, AL</p><h2>Longhi&#39;s: Recipes and Reflections from Maui&#39;s Most Opinionated Restaurateur</h2><p>Bob Longhi, Maui restaurateur and local character, is also an authority on Italian cuisine.

Student volunteers accompany Sophie, the archaeologist, to an unnamed dig in a cornfield, where remains of people from the Archaic Era are being uncovered. Scientific information is spelled out in a straightforward text, defining terms--artifact, midden, and feature--as well as processes, e.g., wet-screening dirt. Dialogue balloons show the students' questions and reactions to their discoveries, while a pet beagle's comments provide comic relief. Inserts complement the text by highlighting comparisons between past and present, how tools were made, and what a basket of modern garbage can reveal. The need for meticulous record-keeping and expert analysis is also included: There is a behind-the-scenes look at a lab plus a complete picture of field work, including the long hours, hot sun, and tedious sifting of dirt. With her inviting approach to a complex process, Duke (Aunt Isabel Makes Trouble, p. 1398, etc.) ensures that this eye-opening field trip will inspire dirt diggers and treasure-seekers everywhere.

She lives in New York City.i <br><p>Sometimes objects seem like they&#x2019;ve witnessed history. I used to imagine that the wooden table we sat around during Kramer&#x2019;s Shakespeare seminar our senior year was as old as Columbia&#x2014;that it had been in that room since 1754, edges worn smooth by centuries of students like us, which of course couldn&#x2019;t be true. But that&#x2019;s how I pictured it. Students sitting there through the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, both World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf.</p><p>It&#x2019;s funny, if you asked me who else was with us that day, I don&#x2019;t think I could tell you. I used to be able to see all their&nbsp;faces so clearly, but thirteen years later I remember only you and Professor Kramer. I can&#x2019;t even recall the name of the TA who came running, late, into the classroom. Later, even, than you.</p><p>Kramer had just finished calling roll when you pushed open the door. You smiled at me, your dimple making a brief appearance as you slipped off your Diamondbacks cap and stuck it into your back pocket. Your eyes landed quickly on the empty seat next to mine, and then you did too.</p><p>&#x201c;And you are?&#x201d; Kramer asked, as you reached into your backpack for a notebook and a pen.</p><p>&#x201c;Gabe,&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;Gabriel Samson.&#x201d;</p><p>Kramer checked the paper in front of him. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s aim for &#x2018;on time&#x2019; for the rest of the semester, Mr. Samson,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Class starts at nine. In fact, let&#x2019;s aim for &#x2018;early.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>You nodded, and Kramer started talking about themes in <i>Julius Caesar</i>.</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;We at the height are ready to decline,&#x2019; &#x201d; he read. &#x201c; &#x2018;There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; / Omitted, all the voyage of their life / Is bound in shallows and in miseries. / On such a full sea are we now afloat, / And we must take the current when it serves, / Or lose our ventures.&#x2019; I trust you all did the reading. Who can tell me what Brutus is saying about fate and free will here?&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll always remember that passage because I&#x2019;ve wondered so many times since that day whether you and I were fated to meet in Kramer&#x2019;s Shakespeare seminar. Whether it&#x2019;s destiny or decision that has kept us connected all these years. Or a combination of both, taking the current when it serves.</p><p>After Kramer spoke, a few people flipped through the text in front of them. You ran your fingers through your curls, and they sprang back into place.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; you said, and the rest of the class joined me in looking at you.</p><p>But you didn&#x2019;t get to finish.</p><p>The TA whose name I can&#x2019;t remember came racing into the room. &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A plane hit one of the twin towers. It came on TV just as I was leaving for class.&#x201d;</p><p>No one knew the significance of her words; not even she did.</p><p>&#x201c;Was the pilot drunk?&#x201d; Kramer asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; the TA said, taking a seat at the table. &#x201c;I waited, but the newscasters had no idea what was going on. They said it was some kind of prop plane.&#x201d;</p><p>If it had happened now, all of our phones would&#x2019;ve been blowing up with news. Pings from Twitter and Facebook and push notifications from the <i>New York Times</i>. But communication then wasn&#x2019;t yet instant and Shakespeare wouldn&#x2019;t be interrupted. We all shrugged it off and Kramer kept talking about <i>Caesar</i>. As I took notes, I watched the fingers of your right hand unconsciously rub against the wood grain of the table. I doodled an image of your thumb with its ragged nail and torn cuticle. I still have the notebook somewhere&#x2014;in a box filled with Lit Hum and Contemporary Civilizations. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ii</p><p>I&#x2019;ll never forget what we said when we left Philosophy Hall; even though the words were nothing special, the conversation is burned into my memory as part of that day. We&#x2019;d started down the steps together. Not exactly together, but next to each other. The air was clear, the sky was blue&#x2014;and everything had changed. We just didn&#x2019;t know it yet.</p><p>People all around us were talking over one another:</p><p>&#x201c;The twin towers collapsed!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;School&#x2019;s canceled!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want to donate blood. Do you know where I can donate blood?&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to you. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I live in East Campus,&#x201d; you said, pointing toward the dorm. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go find out. You&#x2019;re Lucy, right? Where do you live?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hogan,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And yeah, Lucy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice to meet you, Lucy, I&#x2019;m Gabriel.&#x201d; You held out your hand. Amid everything, I shook it, and looked up at you as I did. Your dimple came back. Your eyes shone blue. I thought then, for the first time: <i>He&#x2019;s beautiful.</i></p><p>We went to your suite and watched TV with your roommates, with Adam and Scott and Justin. On the screen bodies dove out of buildings, blackened mounds of rubble sent smoke signals into the sky, and the towers fell in a loop. The devastation numbed us. We stared at the images, unable to reconcile the stories with our reality. The fact that this was happening in&nbsp;our city, seven miles from where we sat, that those were people&#x2014;�actual human beings&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t set in yet. At least not for me. It felt so far away.</p><p>Our cell phones didn&#x2019;t work. You used your dorm phone to call your mom in Arizona to tell her you were fine. I called my parents in Connecticut, who wanted me to come home. They knew someone whose daughter worked at the World Trade Center and no one had heard from her yet. Someone else whose cousin had a breakfast meeting at Windows on the World.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s safer outside Manhattan,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;What if there&#x2019;s anthrax? Or some other biological warfare. Nerve gas.&#x201d;</p><p>I told my dad the subways weren&#x2019;t running. Probably not the trains either.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come get you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll jump in the car now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be okay,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with some friends. We&#x2019;re fine. I&#x2019;ll call you again later.&#x201d; It still didn&#x2019;t feel real.</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Scott said, after I hung up. &#x201c;If I were a terrorist organization, I&#x2019;d drop a bomb on us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What the fuck?&#x201d; Adam said. He was waiting to hear from his uncle, who was part of the NYPD.</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, if you think about it academically&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Scott said, but he didn&#x2019;t get any further.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; Justin said. &#x201c;Seriously, Scott. Not the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I should leave,&#x201d; I said to you then. I didn&#x2019;t really know you. I had just met your friends. &#x201c;My roommates are probably wondering where I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call them,&#x201d; you said, handing the phone back to me. &#x201c;And tell them you&#x2019;re going to the roof of the Wien dorm. Tell them they can meet you there if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With me,&#x201d; you said, and you ran your fingers absently along my braid. It was an intimate gesture, the kind of thing that happens after all barriers of personal space have been breached. Like eating off someone else&#x2019;s plate without asking. And all of a sudden, I felt connected to you, like your hand on my hair meant something more than idle, nervous fingers.</p><p>I thought of that moment, years later, when I decided to donate my hair and the stylist handed me my braid, wrapped in plastic, looking even darker brown than usual. Even though you were a world away then, I felt like I was betraying you, like I was cutting our tie.</p><p>But then, that day, right after you touched my hair you realized what you&#x2019;d done and let your hand drop into your lap. You smiled at me again, but it didn&#x2019;t go to your eyes this time.</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The world felt like it was cracking in pieces, like we&#x2019;d gone through a shattered mirror into the fractured place inside, where nothing made sense, where our shields were down, our walls broken. In that place, there wasn&#x2019;t any reason to say no.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>iii</p><p>We took the elevator up to Wien 11, and then you pulled open a window at the end of the hallway. &#x201c;Someone showed me this sophomore year,&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the most incredible view of New York City you&#x2019;ll ever see.&#x201d;</p><p>We climbed out the window, onto the roof, and I gasped. Smoke billowed up from the southern tip of Manhattan. The whole sky was turning gray, the city shrouded in ash.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; I said. Tears filled my eyes. I pictured what used to be there. Saw the negative space where the towers had stood. It finally hit me. &#x201c;There were people in those buildings.&#x201d;</p><p>Your hand found mine and held it.</p><p>We stood there, staring at the aftermath of destruction, tears dripping down both our cheeks, for how long I don&#x2019;t know. There must have been other people up there with us, but I can&#x2019;t recall them. Just you. And the image of that smoke. It&#x2019;s seared into my brain.</p><p>&#x201c;What happens now?&#x201d; I finally whispered. Seeing it made me understand the magnitude of the attack. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s next?&#x201d;</p><p>You looked at me, and our eyes, still wet with tears, locked with the kind of magnetism that ignores the world around it. Your hand slid to my waist, and I rose up onto my toes to meet your lips halfway. We pressed our bodies together, as if that would protect us from whatever came after. As if the only way to stay safe was to keep my lips on yours. The moment your body enveloped mine, that&#x2019;s how I felt&#x2014;safe, enfolded in the strength and warmth of your arms. Your muscles fluttered against my hands and I buried my fingers in your hair. You wrapped my braid around your palm, tugging it and tipping my head back. And I forgot the world. In that moment, there was only you.</p><p>For years I felt guilty about it. Guilty that we kissed for the first time while the city burned, guilty that I was able to lose myself in you in that moment. But later I learned that we weren&#x2019;t alone. People told me in whispers that they&#x2019;d had sex that day. That they&#x2019;d conceived a child. They&#x2019;d gotten engaged. Said <i>I love you</i> for the first time. There&#x2019;s something about death that makes people want to live. We wanted to live that day, and I don&#x2019;t blame us for it. Not anymore.</p><p>When we broke for breath, I leaned my head against your chest. I listened to your heart and was comforted by its steady beating.</p><p>Did my heartbeat comfort you? Does it still?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>iv</p><p>We went back to your dorm room because you promised me lunch. You wanted to go onto the roof with your camera after we ate, you told me, and take some pictures.</p><p>&#x201c;For the <i>Spectator</i>?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The paper?&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;Nah. For me.&#x201d;</p><p>In the kitchen I got distracted by a stack of your photos&#x2014;black-and-white prints taken all over campus. They were beautiful, bizarre, bathed in light. Images zoomed so far in that an everyday object looked like modern art.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s this one?&#x201d; I asked. After looking for a while, I realized it was a close-up of a bird&#x2019;s nest, lined with what looked like newspapers and magazines and someone&#x2019;s essay for a French literature class.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that was incredible,&#x201d; you told me. &#x201c;Jessica Cho&#x2014;Do you know her? She sings a cappella? David Blum&#x2019;s girlfriend?&#x2014;she told me about this nest that she could see out her window that someone&#x2019;s homework got worked into. So I went to check it out. I had to hang out the window to get this shot. Jess made Dave hold my ankles because she was afraid I would fall. But I&nbsp;got it.&#x201d;</p><p>After that story I saw you differently. You were daring, brave, committed to capturing art. Looking back, I&#x2019;m guessing that&#x2019;s what you wanted me to think. You were trying to impress me, but I didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time. I just thought: <i>Wow.</i> I thought: <i>He&#x2019;s wonderful.</i> But what was true then, and has been true as long as I&#x2019;ve known you, is that you find beauty everywhere. You notice things other people don&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve always admired about you.</p><p>&#x201c;Is this what you want to do?&#x201d; I asked then indicating the pictures.</p><p>You shook your head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just for fun,&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;My mom&#x2019;s an artist. You should see what she can do, these gorgeous enormous abstracts, but she makes a living by painting small canvases of Arizona sunsets for tourists. I don&#x2019;t want that kind of life, creating what sells.&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned against the counter and looked at the rest of the photographs. Rust leaching into a stone bench, cracked veins of&nbsp;marble, corrosion on a metal railing. Beauty where I&#x2019;d never imagined it could be. &#x201c;Is your dad an artist, too?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Your face closed. I could see it, like a door shutting behind your eyes. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;</p><p>I had stumbled into a fault line I didn&#x2019;t know was there. I filed that away&#x2014;I was discovering the landscape of you. Already I was hoping it was terrain I&#x2019;d learn well, one that would become second nature to navigate.</p><p>You were quiet. I was quiet. The TV was still blaring in the background, and I heard the newscasters talking about the Pentagon and the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. The horror of the situation rushed over me again. I put your photographs down. It seemed perverse to focus on beauty then. But looking back, maybe that was exactly the right thing to do.</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you say we were going to eat lunch?&#x201d; I asked, even though I wasn&#x2019;t hungry, even though the images flashing across the television screen made my stomach churn.</p><p>The door opened behind your eyes. &#x201c;That I did,&#x201d; you said, with a nod.</p><p>All you had the ingredients for were nachos. So, mechanically, I sliced tomatoes and opened a can of beans with a rusty can opener while you arranged tortilla chips in one of those throwaway foil trays and grated cheese into a chipped cereal bowl.</p><p>&#x201c;What about you?&#x201d; you asked, as if our conversation hadn&#x2019;t gotten derailed.</p><p>&#x201c;Hm?&#x201d; I pressed the top of the can into the beans so I could lever it off.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you an artist?&#x201d;</p><p>I put the metal disc down on the counter. &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The most creative thing I do is write stories for my roommates.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About what?&#x201d; you asked, your head cocked to one side.</p><p>I looked down so you wouldn&#x2019;t see me blush. &#x201c;This is embarrassing,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but they&#x2019;re about a teacup pig named Hamilton who accidentally got accepted into a college meant for rabbits.&#x201d;</p><p>You let out a surprised laugh. &#x201c;Hamilton.

This book contains eighteen stories, which presents an archetypal schoolchild whose world of mishaps, confusions and downright naughtiness tends to raise a smile.</p><p>Rene Goscinny (1926-77), born in Paris, lived most of his early years in Buenos Aires and New York. He returned to France in the 1950s where he met Jean-Jacques Sempe and together they created the character for Nicholas, the famous schoolboy. He later worked with Alberto Uderzo, on making the adventures of Asterix the Gaul. A prolific and internationally successful children&#39;s author, he is also the creater of Lucky Luke and Dingodossiers, among others. He also received Cesars for his numerous animated cartoons. Jean-Jacques Sempe (b.1932) is one of the world&#39;s most successful illustrators and cartoonists. He is the illustrator of the classic children&#39;s-book character, Nicholas, and author of a collection of some thirty albums of his cartoons and graphic novels, all published or to be published by Phaidon. His world-renowned illustrations and cartoons are featured on the cover of the New Yorker and in Paris Match. Anthea Bell was awarded the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the Helen and Kurt Wolff Prize (USA) in 2002 for her translation of W.G. Sebald&#39;s Austerlitz. Her many works of translation from French and German (for which she has received several other awards) include the Nicholas books and, with Derek Hockridge, the entire Asterix the Gaul saga by Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo.&#39;Nicholas has an engagingly positive outlook on life, loves school despite his academic fallings, and has refined the art of driving his parents up the wall, while remaining blissfully unaware of how infuriating they find him.&#39;</p><h2>Plays, 1996-2000 (Maxwell)</h2><p><p>This volume collects for the first time the work of one of America&#x2019;s most important, vital and original young voices.

Once each season, Ben and Caroline visit their cousin Nick, who lives in a house in a forest clearing. With the help of Uncle Hank, a forest ranger, the children observe the wildlife in the vicinity of a 300-year-old oak. They learn about some of the animals' habits as well as a bit about ecology, pollution, and the life cycle of the tree. Muller has appended several pages of diagrams and illustrations that contain tidbits of additional information, and several identification pages with clear likenesses of forest birds, leaves, plants, and mushrooms. Acrylic paintings done in a primitive, realistic style have a charm akin to that of Barbara Cooney's work. Vivid colors change with each season, and tiny details abound. Although the book was originally published in Germany, all of the flora and fauna can be found in the U.S. and Canada as well. This title cannot compete in terms of informational content with the abundant factual literature available on the topic for the same age group, but might be read in preparation for a nature hike.<br><i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Merry Christmas, Space Case</h2><p>Buddy McGee eagerly awaits a promised Christmas visit from his friend, the thing from outer space.</p><p>Buddy's pal, " the thing from outer sp a ce, " returns (as he promised in Space Case ) and defends his friend from the hilariously nasty Goober twins.

He is the creator of the Legacy of Aldenata series, which has become a&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling series with&nbsp;<b>over one million copies in print</b>. The series contains&nbsp;<i>A Hymn Before Battle,</i>&nbsp;<i>Gust Front</i>,&nbsp;<i>When the Devil Dances</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hell&#x2019;s Faire,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Eye of the Storm</i>. Ringo created nationally best-selling techno-thriller novels about Mike Harmon (<i>Ghost</i>,&nbsp;<i>Kildar</i>,&nbsp;<i>Choosers of the Slain</i>,&nbsp;<i>Unto the Breach</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Deeper Blue,&nbsp;</i>and, with Ryan Sear,&nbsp;<i>Tiger by the Tail</i>). His techno-thriller&nbsp;<i>The Last Centurion&nbsp;</i>was also a national bestseller. A more playful twist on the future is found in novels of the Looking-Glass series:&nbsp;<i>Into the Looking Glass</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vorpal Blade</i>,&nbsp;<i>Manxome Foe,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Claws That Catch</i>, the last three in collaboration with Travis S. Taylor. His audience was further entranced with four collaborations alongside fellow&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author David Weber:&nbsp;<i>March Upcountry</i>,<i>&nbsp;March to the Sea</i>,&nbsp;<i>March to the Stars&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>We Few</i>. There are an additional five collaborative spinoffs from the Posleen series:&nbsp;<i>The Hero</i>, written with Michael Z.

And his science-based zombie apocalypse Black Tide Rising series includes&nbsp;<i>Under a Graveyard Sky, To Sail a Darkling Sea, Islands of Rage and Hope</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Strands of Sorrow.&nbsp;</i>A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.Michael O'Shea, a fireplug of an iron-pumping ex-soldier, leaves game design behind to train and then lead power-armored infantry in a merciless battle against the equally merciless, centauroid Posleen for the sake of Earth's allies. Several subplots show Ringo's fondness for special ops types and marines, and his experience as a paratrooper shows in the way he handles military small-group politics and disciplinary problems. The subplots point up the potential grimness of Earth finding itself under siege, if not actually under assault. (Don't worry, that will probably come; this book has <i>series</i> written between all the lines.) The interstellar skulduggery is thick, and the final action sequence, occupying a third of the book, juxtaposes power armor, aliens, lasers, and leopard tanks, and is practically impossible not to read in one sitting. An exceedingly impressive first novel is what we have here. Standard military sf based on a standard premise--humans as the desperately needed warrior allies of alien pacifists--it may be, but it is executed with skill, verve, and wit. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

James Joyce's prose was denounced as obscene, and the book was banned in the United States and Great Britain. Controversy surrounded the work throughout Joyce's lifetime, and he claimed that the book would keep scholars busy for centuries.<br>Joyce was right. The book has become a veritable minefield for scholars, and has led to one of the world's most lucrative literary industries. In The Scandal of Ulysses, Bruce Arnold compellingly traces the life of Ulysses from its inception, through the great publication scandals of the 1920s and 1930s, and concludes with a lengthy examination of the copyright wars that have engulfed the book in recent years.<br>In this, the most complete history of Ulysses written to date, Arnold draws a vivid portrait of Dublin, London, and Paris in the period between the two great wars, through which we gain a more complete understanding of both early conflicts and more recent ones.<br>Chief among these is Ulysses: The Corrected Text, which was hailed as the ideal version of the book when it appeared in 1986, and its German editor, Hans Walter Gable, as a brilliant scholar who had restored Joyce to the reading public in as near perfect a version as was possible. Two years later, he was publicly denounced by John Kidd, a young American Joyce scholar, and one of the most ferocious literary controversies of recent times erupted.<br>Joyceans worldwide were deeply divided over the merits and defects of the new edition. Arguments against the Gabler version grew in volume. The earlier 1961 Ulysses was restored to the market place. New publishers came forward to edit and produce new versions. And the legal copyright, which ran out at the end of 1991, has caused more chaos, particularly in light of a new version of Ulysses edited by John Kidd, being published by W. W. Norton.<br>In a lively work of literary detection, with an American introduction written for the new edition. Bruce Arnold sets out the background, examines the legal loopholes, analyzes the arguments on both sides, looks at some of the hidden agendas, including controversial letters, and comes up with surprising and provocative conclusions.</p><p>The amazing printing history of James Joyce's Ulysses and its editorial disasters. Novelist Arnold (Running to Paradise, 1983, etc.) does a fine job of setting before us the horrors of getting a true version of Ulysses into print--which apparently hasn't happened yet. Though much of Arnold's material repeats itself, the repetition is all part of the disaster bred by Joyce himself and recently complicated by the three-volume Hans Walter Gabler critical edition (1984) and Gabler's one-volume Ulysses: The Corrected Text (1986), both of which caused a mudfest among Joyceans. While writing the novel in Paris (1914-21), Joyce sold individual chapters to American collectors. Those chapters also acted as the texts for first publication in The Little Review. The chapters, which bore Joyce's corrections, were never returned to him, while his own carbons had not been corrected. When The Egoist Press printed Ulysses, Joyce made entirely new corrections inconsistent with the already published chapters, which he could not get hold of, and meanwhile added nearly a third to the novel's bulk on his galley proofs. Joyce, who was going blind, was a poor editor and even embroidered imaginatively on his Paris printer's errors, thus establishing a first edition not only aswim with errors and gaga sentences but also wildly inconsistent with his own manuscripts. Moreover, when Joyce began Finnegan's Wake, he lost interest in correcting Ulysses. Joyce did help in the French translation of Ulysses, which sometimes helps to make sense of his English. When Gabler came along to establish a corrected text, however, he threw out the first edition, assembled only manuscripts, corrupt magazine versions, etc., and intuitively put together a still newer Ulysses that has incensed Joyceans. But the problems are infinitely more complicated than this. Essential. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A Joyce scholar from Ireland, Arnold here jumps into the controversy surrounding the 1986 publication of Ulysses: The Corrected Text , edited by Hans Walter Gabler. Arnold circuitously traces the history of Joyce's masterpiece from its original publication in Paris in 1922 by Shakespeare and Co. through the labyrinth of successive versions edited by Joyce and others, partly in an attempt to get the ban (on grounds of indecency) lifted from the work. Today venerated by scholars, Ulysses , Arnold contends, has become a prisoner of Joyce academicians who wrangle over the "correct" version. Arnold argues that Gabler's 1986 edition, a computer-based merging of all previous editions, is a seriously flawed work whose publication was motivated by the Joyce estate's desire to maintain the financial benefits of copyright. Although this study will be of interest to scholars, general readers will be hard put to decode the nitpicking. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Barbie Loves Ballet (Barbie) (Pictureback(R))</h2><p>Kelly loves ballet, but she&#x2019;s nervous about performing at her first recital.

As Scobey writes in the introduction, "The world of food has changed dramatically...." There are new tools, products, and attitudes; there is more interest in international cooking and more attention being paid to health. What's left of the original book's approach is the good description of basic principles and recipes. "Cooking know-how" includes a helpful discussion of ingredients (including amounts of meat and fish recommended per serving), tools that may or may not be needed, terms that may be misunderstood by beginners, handy tips, and safety pointers. All are clear and to the point; the author understands that readers want to get to the preparations as soon as possible. The 119 recipes and their variations are all made from scratch, and are healthy without being extreme. Microwave instructions are given not as a way of life, but as a possible contribution to the goodness of the dish being prepared. Patience Brewster's pen-and-ink drawings are a pleasant addition. Sara and Zachary Williamson's Kids Cook! (Williamson, 1992) is a comparable, current cookbook for this age group. It's more folksy and fun, but not as basic and comprehensive as this one.<br><i>Carolyn Jenks, First Parish Unitarian Church, Portland, ME</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-10. Scobey has adapted one of the bibles of basic good cooking to reflect today's busy life-styles and time-saving techniques. With new young cooks in mind, she has taken particular care to define and illustrate cooking terms and various appliances, baking pans, and other kitchen tools. She also thoughtfully includes precautions and miscellaneous but valuable cooking and menu selection tips. Recipes for classic soups, pie crusts, biscuits, baked chicken, and chocolate chip cookies share space with instructions for making pesto, pasta sauces, hot dogs, and hamburgers to cover a range of traditional and contemporary tastes. All recipes begin with a list of necessary ingredients and equipment, followed by numbered steps for successful preparation. Most of the dishes are quite simple; a few, such as "Vegetable Lasagna Roll-ups," require numerous steps but are nonetheless tempting and achievable. The attractively designed pages are laced with delicate drawings of herbs, flowers, fruits, and other foods, a tantalizing enhancement to a promising cookbook. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>Jess (American Girl Today)</h2><p>When ten-year-old Jess McConnell meets a new friend on her trip to the ancient Maya ruins in Belize, she is invited on an eco-adventure and makes some real discoveries--about the dangers in the Belizean jungle, about the people who have lived there since long ago, and about herself.

Because it teaches that when we have faith in Jesus,&nbsp; we are connected to him . . . forever! In this book, Natalie Brand unpacks the incredible reality of the Christian's union with Jesus Christ. With all the new trends in spirituality; Brand calls her readers to reclaim a spirituality of truth...raw God-truth from God's Word. These pages will help you discover the power of the Bible's teaching that believers are united to Jesus for forgiveness but also for daily life; a truth that is deeply relevant whether you are sitting at your desk, at your steering wheel, or standing at your sink at home . . . Union with Christ changes everything!</p><p>Natalie Brand (Ph.D., Trinity St David) has also written Complementarian Spirituality: Reformed Women and Union with Christ (Wipf &amp; Stock). She teaches the course 'Female Spirituality' at Wales Evangelical School of Theology (WEST) and is passionate about women studying theology.Natalie Brand dusts off the somewhat neglected doctrine of union with Christ and polishes it up to the glory it deserves to a new generation of Christian women. In a world of self-help and ten- point plans, we need to be reminded that it is the in-Christness of believers that is the key to Christian growth, to godly living and to enjoying church. It is in fact the very heart of the gospel and far from being theoretical is personal and practical. This book's theology is solid and deep while the applications are thoroughly contemporary and relevant.--Ann Benton<br><br>In this rare book, packed with theological teaching, Natalie Brand has combined practical daily Christian living with the unusual dimension of being directed particularly towards women. She has achieved a remarkable balance in a work full of interest, familiar situations and pitfalls while maintaining a depth of spiritual insight to encourage us forward in our Christian experience.--Faith Cook<br><br>Life is busy. People are searching for spirituality. Culture says truth is relative. Natalie addresses all of these situations with one answer: salvation in Jesus Christ, as described in the Bible, is the only and sufficient foundation for our lives. She applies this truth to many areas in a contemporary and interesting manner, for our practical and spiritual benefit.--Mary Beeke</p><h2>Science Fiction: Classic Stories from the Golden Age of Science Fiction</h2><p>These fantastic tales are as fresh and relevant today as they were when they first appeared in the 1940s, the Golden Age of Science Fiction.

Floated in space to watch planets spin. Lain naked on mossy ground, lost in one another, under so many stars&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> Those had been real. These couldn&#x2019;t be. The ceiling lay be�neath a covering of formed concrete, plas, and a significant amount of natural stone, a roof he&#x2019;d built to keep out more than the night sky. Could be a dune curling overtop as well, it being sandstorm season. <br> &nbsp;<br> Yet, still, stars twinkled overhead, wheeling in formation as if he watched them through time. <br> &nbsp;<br> A dream. That was it. He shut his eyes, fingers straying to the cool metal band around his wrist. Touch seemed odd, for a dream. <br> &nbsp;<br> He opened his eyes. Looked up. Surely only in a dream could a segment of that starry scape flex...<br> &nbsp;<br> Bend...<br> &nbsp;<br> Lean down, closer and closer, those stars about to crush him&#x2014; <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>/need/~location?~/urgency/ </i><br> &nbsp;<br> For the&#x2014;&#x201c;No more!&#x201d; he shouted, furious. &#x201c;Get out of here!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A heavy arm&#x2014;something arm-ish&#x2014; lopped across his chest and slid away. Jason Morgan squirmed in the opposite direction. &#x201c;On! On full!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The portlights obeyed, blazing into every corner of the room. <br> &nbsp;<br> He was alone. <br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I heard you the first time.&#x201d; Huido Maarmatoo&#x2019;kk emphasized the &#x201c;first.&#x201d; &#x201c;A Rugheran was on your ceiling. The starry kind, like the ones you saw on Cersi, not the dark greasy kind here. Your shout woke me from a most pleasant dream, you know.&#x201d; A sigh like rain on plas. <br> &nbsp;<br> His hands wanted to tremble. Morgan wrapped them around his warm cup, guiding it to his lips with care. The kitchen felt strange. Too bright. He hadn&#x2019;t, he thought abruptly, sat at this table for&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t, since, that was it. Hadn&#x2019;t left his quarters. <br> &nbsp;<br> Hadn&#x2019;t bothered to move, in case it hurt. Fine plan, that was. All of him hurt. <br> &nbsp;<br> Most of him stank. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not that it mattered. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yesterday, you saw a Rugheran in the accommodation. You shouted then, too. And threw a jar of something at it, making a mess, at which point it disappeared. Can&#x2019;t say I blame it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Morgan glowered through the steam at his companion. Gleam�ing black eyeballs, each on their stalk, lined the opening between the gently pulsing disks that served as a head. Unblinking eye�balls. He should know better by now than try to stare down a Carasian. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my imagination. They travel through&#x2014;&#x201d; the M&#x2019;hir, he almost said, and flinched. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t use doors. You know that. They&#x2019;re here and they&#x2019;re real.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Unlike what else he saw when alone: the curve of a smile, the luxurious flood of red- old hair, somber gray eyes flashing with sudden heat&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> Sira. <br> &nbsp;<br> Always, always, no matter how he tried to stop there, stay, the ending followed. The furious boil of waves on an unreal beach&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> Her fingers, letting go&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> That hollow, inside, where she&#x2019;d been. <br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d curl into a ball and shiver until he fell asleep or passed out, always cold. So very cold&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> A soft <i>chink </i>as clawtips met under his nose. Morgan refocused. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; He tried not to snap, wearily grateful Huido bore with his tempers and accepted his silence. He wasn&#x2019;t ready to talk. <br> &nbsp;<br> They hadn&#x2019;t spoken in what might be days, come to think of it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Something was different. He blinked. His friend&#x2019;s massive car�apace was peppered with gleaming metal fragments, between the usual hooks for weaponry, the fragments from a groundcar that had exploded too close. Huido&#x2019;d removed the largest to keep as souvenirs&#x2014;but that wasn&#x2019;t it. <br> &nbsp;<br> The black shell was a maze of fresh scrapes and gouges, some deep. &#x201c;What happened to&#x2014;&#x201d; Morgan&#x2019;s voice broke. Gods. &#x201c;What did I do?&#x201d; a whisper. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t yourself,&#x201d; Huido informed him. The big alien eased back, wiggling the glistening pink stub of what had been his largest claw. &#x201c;Nor am I. After molt, I will be magnificent once again! We need more beer.&#x201d; In a confiding tone, &#x201c;Beer speeds things up.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d hit bottom, that&#x2019;s when they&#x2019;d last spoken. When he&#x2019;d&#x2014; Morgan&#x2019;s face went stark with grief. &#x201c;I cursed you. Ordered you to leave.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bah. Why would I listen? Your <i>grist </i>wasn&#x2019;t right.&#x201d; The intact claw, capable of severing his torso in half, tugged gently at his hair. &#x201c;Better. Still stinks.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I attacked you.&#x201d; Morgan remembered it all now, too well. He&#x2019;d been wild, raving. Huido had squeezed himself into the door opening to seal him in his quarters. Morgan had struck out with whatever was in the room&#x2014;until he&#x2019;d collapsed, sobbing, at Huido&#x2019;s feet. <br> &nbsp;<br> Eyestalks bent to survey the marks. &#x201c;You tried,&#x201d; the Carasian corrected smugly, then chuckled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you didn&#x2019;t hurt your�self.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Morgan reached up. After a second, the centermost cluster of eyes parted, and deadly needlelike jaws protruded, tips closing on his hand with tender precision. &#x201c;Huido&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The jaws retracted and Morgan found himself reflected in a dozen shiny black eyes. &#x201c;The past.&#x201d; The lower claw snapped. &#x201c;The present! Why are the Rugherans here?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The Human dropped his gaze, staring into the sombay. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re looking for&#x2014;&#x201d; His sigh rippled the liquid. &#x201c;For her.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To the Eleventh Sandy Armpit of Urga Large with them!&#x201d; Huido roared, shaking dishware and hurting Morgan&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Tell them I said so!&#x201d; After a short pause, he went on in his nor�mal voice. &#x201c;You can talk to them, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d; It sounded sullen even to him, but Morgan couldn&#x2019;t help that, any more than he couldn&#x2019;t help but <i>hear </i>the Rugherans: their matrix-like speech, emotion blended with sin�gle words or the simplest of phrases, flooded his mind despite his tightest shields. Cruel, to come to him here&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;where he came for peace. <br> &nbsp;<br> It hadn&#x2019;t always been so. The first time Morgan set foot on Ettler&#x2019;s Planet, he&#x2019;d been dumped there. His own fault, having yet to gain the most rudimentary knowledge of what offended non-humans. The Trants could have removed his limbs for suggesting&#x2014;well, being dumped had been the best option, suf�fice it to say, and one reason he&#x2019;d gone on to learn everything he could about the manners of others. <br> &nbsp;<br> That sorry day, he&#x2019;d prided himself on a close escape. Instead, he&#x2019;d been left in the worst place for a telepath, even one of his latent ability, for this world&#x2019;s Human population contained more than its share of the minimally Talented: those whose thoughts leaked constantly, without self-awareness or restraint. Morgan&#x2019;s natural shields protected his mind from others. <br> &nbsp;<br> He didn&#x2019;t know how to keep their minds out of his. <br> &nbsp;<br> Half-maddened by the bedlam, somehow Morgan had taken an aircar and flown out into the desert, unable to stop until he reached <i>quiet. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2014;here&#x2014;he&#x2019;d stayed to recover. Only Huido had been welcome, the painful maelstrom of Carasian thought patterns at a level easy to avoid. <br> &nbsp;<br> Later, healed, and having traded with Omacrons, non-human telepaths, for their mind-shielding technique, Morgan was able to protect himself. In space, in the <i>Fox, </i>he hadn&#x2019;t needed shields at all. <br> &nbsp;<br> With Sira, he&#x2019;d wanted none. Her thoughts had been his&#x2014;her mindvoice the last he&#x2019;d <i>heard. </i>The last he ever wanted to <i>hear. </i>He&#x2019;d never open his mind to another&#x2019;s again. <br> &nbsp;<br> Till the Rugherans, who had no right&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Human set down his cup. It tipped, spilling dark liquid. Unfair. Huido kept the kitchen spotless. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get that.&#x201d; He rose and was forced to grip the table to steady himself. It took longer than he remembered, walking to the counter, and he had to con�centrate: pick up the wipe, return, clean the mess. <br> &nbsp;<br> Eyestalks twisted, following his slow progress. &#x201c;You need a molt, too.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wish I could.&#x201d; Something about molting&#x2014; &#x201c;Order as much beer as you want.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A chuckle. &#x201c;Fear not, my brother, I&#x2019;ve taken care of it&#x2014;and a case of Brillian brandy, for variety.&#x201d; A less happy, &#x201c;If not the storms.&#x201d; The Carasian loathed sand, claiming grains worked into the seams of his shell. He cheered. &#x201c;While we wait, I could take care of your unwanted visitors.&#x201d; With a disturbingly coy tilt of his carapace, Huido indicated the weapons, most illegal even here in the Fringe, housed on the pot rack. <br> &nbsp;<br> Morgan shook his head. &#x201c;Let them poke around till they&#x2019;re satisfied.&#x201d; No need to point out the unlikelihood of any weapon affecting beings of the M&#x2019;hir. <br> &nbsp;<br> As for the Rugherans&#x2019; reaction...should more than a jar be tossed at them? <br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d prefer not to&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> The kitchen tilted. The Human lurched into his chair, sending the rest of his sombay, and cup, to the floor. He cursed under his breath. A newly hatched Skenkran was stronger. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me?&#x201d; under his breath. <br> &nbsp;<br> Shiny black eyes converged on him, then aimed idly&#x2014;and simultaneously&#x2014;anywhere else: the weapon-containing pot rack, the ceiling, the floor, the walls. <br> &nbsp;<br> Done it to himself, that meant. <br> &nbsp;<br> Morgan let out a slow breath, tasting the stink on it, the truth. <br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d ignored his body&#x2019;s needs. Refused food. Drank himself to sleep. Refused to move. He&#x2019;d a vague memory of feeling the pinch of shots. Stims, likely. <br> &nbsp;<br> For how long? <br> &nbsp;<br> Judging by the tremor in his hands, it could have been weeks. <br> &nbsp;<br> Neglect? Cowardice. He winced. Hadn&#x2019;t he told Sira: <i>Let go and live? </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Hadn&#x2019;t she asked the same promise of him? <br> &nbsp;<br> Shouldn&#x2019;t have taught her to be a trader, he told himself, meaning not a word. <br> &nbsp;<br> Morgan summoned his remaining strength and stood. &#x201c;To�morrow,&#x201d; he announced. <br> &nbsp;<br> One eyestalk swiveled back to him. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tonight, then.&#x201d; Three more joined the first. Doubt, that was. &#x201c;Some supper&#x2014;just not&#x2014;make anything,&#x201d; he capitulated. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll eat it.&#x201d; No guarantees it would stay down. <br> &nbsp;<br> The full force of the Carasian&#x2019;s gaze returned. &#x201c;At the table?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rush me.&#x201d; The Human pretended to squint at the lights. &#x201c;Too bright. And the Rugheran ruined my sleep.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> But his lips cracked, stretched by the ghost of a smile. The first&#x2014;since.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Uglified Ducky</h2><p>You may think you know the story of The Ugly Duckling, but think again. In the capable hands of his narrator Maynard Moose, storyteller Willy Claflin takes us on a wacky journey where family becomes fambly and extremely becomes distremely. (English teachers take heart; a Moose-English glossary is included.)</p><p><p>Willy Claflin Bio: </p><p> Willy Claflin is the author of four award winning LittleFolk picture books: The Uglified Ducky, Rapunzel &amp; The Seven Dwarfs, The Bully Goat Grim, and The Little Moose Who Couldn't Go To Sleep. Willy's retelling of original and classic traditional stories incorporates a unique wacky fairy tale persona with his trusted sidekick, Maynard Moose. Willy insists that Maynard is the actual author of these stories and that he, Willy, is merely the Moose-to-English translator of these whimsical tales. All of Willy's Maynard Moose picture books include a CD with a field recording of Maynard narrating the story and a Moose-to-English dictionary for those of us not fluent in &#x201c;Moose-speak&#x201d;. Willy grew up in New Hampshire and spent his introverted childhood daydreaming and wandering through the woods, listening to his father's bedtime stories and worrying about the wolf under his bed. As a student at Harvard University, he studied American and French Literature while spending his free time performing music and comedy in the lively Boston folk music scene. After graduation, he turned his attention to classroom teaching and found that he had a gift for engaging his students with creative curriculum and developed his major puppet characters: Maynard Moose, Boring Beaver, Socklops, and Gorf. When he decided to commit to performing and touring full-time, he brought a wealth of stories and puppet monologues to his repertoire along with a deep appreciation of how to connect with kids of all ages. Today Willy is a popular storyteller who crisscrosses the country performing at special events and in schools. As an author, his four Maynard Moose picture books have won ten awards and received critical praise. He is a favorite performer at the annual National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, TN, at regional festivals and in classrooms across the land. Willy is also a member of the prestigious National Storytelling Networks' Circle of Excellence and he often records and performs traditional ballads and blues with his son, Brian Claflin. Currently, when he isn't touring, Willy lives in San Francisco with his wife and business partner, Jacqueline Darrigrand.

He has worked as a designer for feature animated film, as a commercial illustrator, and as an illustrator for children's picture books. He has successfully collaborated with the author and storyteller, Willy Claflin on four award winning Maynard Moose picture books.<br></p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;Every full moon in the Northern Piney Woods, the animals gather to hear Maynard Moose tell his Mother Moose Tales in "old Moose Speech." The glossary begins with a tongue-in-cheek "Parental Warning" about "moose grammar, spelling, and usage, all of which have been known to scrumble up the human brain!" Poor little moose wanders away and falls asleep in a nest with five ducky eggs. "Boy, I hope the other ones will turn out better" is Mommy Ducky's reaction when she sees him. The story line echoes Andersen's "The Ugly Duckling" as the "uglified ducky" tries his best to waddle, quack, and swim, with humorous results. Predictably, all ends well, and Maynard Moose closes his story with a twist on the usual moral: If you don't fit into your "fambly...that does not mean you are uglified.... It just means you have not found out what you really are yet." Stimson's colorful illustrations are a riot, featuring stylized shapes, funny expressions, and animated scenes. A CD of the story performed hilariously by Claflin is delightful. This fresh, lively story is laugh-out-loud funny.&#x2014;<i>Lee Bock, Glenbrook Elementary School, Pulaski, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Simultaneous.</p><p>In 1978, when Michael Hart&#39;s controversial book The 100 was first published, critics objected that Hart had the nerve not only to select who he thought were the most influential people in history, but also to rank them according to their importance. Needless to say, the critics were wrong, and to date over 60,000 copies of the book have sold. Hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage. Thus, the publication of this revised and updated edition of The 100. As before, Hart&#39;s yardstick is influence: not the greatest people, but the most influential, the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings, determined the rise and fall of civilizations, changed the course of history. With incisive biographies, Hart describes their careers and contributions. Explaining his ratings, he presents a new perspective on history, gathering together the vital facts about the world&#39;s greatest religious and political leaders, inventors, writers, philosophers, explorers, artists, and innovators - from Asoka to Zoroaster. Most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketches. Hart&#39;s selections may be surprising to some. Neither Jesus nor Marx, but Muhammad, is designated as the most influential person in human history. The writer&#39;s arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers, but whether or not they agree with him, his manner of ranking is both informative and entertaining. The 100, revised and updated, is truly a monumental work. It promises to be just as controversial, just as thought-provoking, and just as successful as its predecessor - a perfectaddition to any history or philosophy reference section.<b>Michael H. Hart</b> is an American author and astrophysicist. His first and most famous book, <i>The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History</i>, was published in 1978 and has sold more than half a million copies in 15 languages.</p><h2>English Garden through the Twentieth Century</h2><p>Jane Brown&#39;s The English Garden in Our Time was originally published in 1966. It was the first book to attempt to describe the influences upon gardens and their design from the heyday of Gertrude Jekyll, one hundred years ago, to the innovative ideas of Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe. This new edition, re-titled The English Garden Through the Twentieth Century , has been revised to bring the story up to date, and add many new colour pictures. There is a detailed description of Gertrude Jekyll&#39;s life at Munstead Wood, followed by the story of the garden world she masterminded. These include arts and crafts gardens, and her work with Edwin Lutyens and other famous architects. Chapter three is devoted to the arts and crafts set piece, Rodmarton Manor. Jane Brown explores the lavish influences upon gardens during the thirties, and after the Second World war - the influences of the Italian style, the Modern Movement, of the making of Sissinghurst Castle&#39;s garden, and of Hidcote Manor and the &#39;new Georgia</p><p>Jane Brown is the author of 10 books on gardeners and architects of mainly the 20th century.</p><h2>Touch of Genius: The Life of T.E.

Herbert G. Houze, the former curator of the Winchester Arms Museum, has written a complete account of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company&#39;s development from the founding of its predecessor, the New Haven Arms Company in 1856, to the sale of the firm by Olin Corporation in 1981.Using corporate records and other sources that have come to light during the last decade, Houze reconstructs many aspects of the Winchester Company&#39;s history unknown to previous researchers. As a result, a new and far more complete picture of the firm&#39;s complex development is presented. Many commonly held beliefs about Winchester&#39;s growth and operations, such as the orderly corporate succession from the New Haven Arms Company to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company or the reasons for its financial collapse in 1930, are dispelled. In addition, seven new models of Winchester firearms are identified and fully described. Houze also sheds new light on the development of more familiar models and the men who designed them. The entire spectrum of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company&#39;s history, its successes, as well as its failures, is presented here for the first time.</p><p>Houze's lavishly illustrated company history demonstrates that the name <i>Winchester</i>, chiefly associated with the manufacture of guns (especially rifles), should also be linked to such products as washing machines and sporting goods. Still, as expected, the emphasis is on firearms in this survey of the company's fortunes, from its 1856 emergence out of the ashes of the failed Volcanic Repeating Arms Company to its 1981 sale by then-owner Olin Industries. Houze recites the facts and figures of the burgeoning arms giant and sketches such important players in its history as Oliver F. Winchester and Frank Burton. Serious firearms collectors and aficionados will want to read about the seven newly identified 1860s Winchester models, while popular culturalists will enjoy the book's extensive examination of the art engraved on the company's products. Many examples of advertising art, some by N. C. Wyeth and other famous illustrators, appear alongside photos of the Winchester factories. More than just another corporate history, this book is crammed with Americana and the history of U.S. industrial organizations and work conditions. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Another Fine Myth</h2><p>A comic fantasy of mayhem and mythadventure.

Or I was until my blasted assistant, the redoubtable Miss Jane Smythe-Haughton, made a completely unrequested observation that I was &#x201c;anything but well versed in this particular form of cartography&#x201d; and I should have an expert examine the bloody thing. <br> <br>Her distrust in my knowledge is as large as it is abiding.

If I&#x2019;m going to face these monkeys, I&#x2019;ll need a drink.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not monkeys, but lovely women who&#x2014;&#x201d; She caught his expression and grimaced. &#x201c;Perhaps a drink will improve your spirits. Lady Bellforth usually sets the refreshment table by the library doors.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded and stepped in that direction. As if in answer to that one step, fans and lashes fluttered, seemingly hoping to trap him in a gossamer hold. &#x201c;For the love of Ra,&#x201d; he said through gritted teeth, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t they have anything better to do than stare?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re famous,&#x201d; Mary said calmly. <br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wish to be famous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you are, so you&#x2019;ll just have to live with it.&#x201d; She placed a hand on his arm. &#x201c;Just smile and nod and we&#x2019;ll make our way through this crowd in no time at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Smiling won&#x2019;t work, but this will.&#x201d; He scowled instead, noticing with glee that several of the flowery fans stopped fluttering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael, you can&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He placed his hand firmly under her elbow and led her into the crowd, scowling at first one hopeful-looking miss and then another. They blushed, then sagged, as if he&#x2019;d stabbed their empty little hearts. <br> <br>Mary made an impatient noise and then said in a low voice, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never get another sponsor if you keep that up. These women are the daughters and sisters of wealthy men who could aid your expeditions greatly!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They are cotton-headed bits of fluff, and I refuse to pander to them.&#x201d; He almost stopped when one of them boldly winked at him. &#x201c;Good God, what happened to female modesty while I was in the wilds of Egypt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More to the point, what happened to gentlemanly manners?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I left those worthless skills on the reedy shores of the Nile,&#x201d; he retorted. &#x201c;Good riddance, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave him a sour look. &#x201c;Our brothers are right: you have turned into a barbarian.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why? Because I do and say what must be said?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, because you barrel through life and never stop to consider the consequences of your words and actions. I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>A young woman stepped into their path, almost thrust into place by the girls who circled behind her. <br> <br>Tall, with a large nose and auburn curls, decorated with pearl pins, she appeared to be all of seventeen. &#x201c;Mr. Hurst! How nice to see you again.&#x201d; She dipped a grand curtsy, her smirk letting him know that she expected a welcome greeting.<br> <br>Michael lifted a brow but said nothing.<br> <br>Her cheeks bloomed red, her lips pressed in swift irritation, though she hid it almost immediately behind a forced smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Miss Lydia Latham. We met at Lady MacLean&#x2019;s soiree.&#x201d; <br> <br>Michael stared as Miss Latham held out her hand expectantly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooof!&#x201d; He rubbed his side and glared at his sister, who&#x2019;d just elbowed him. &#x201c;Must you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She leaned closer and said through her gritted smile in a voice only he could hear, &#x201c;I will stomp on your foot right here and now, in front of the entire world, if you don&#x2019;t take her hand and at least pretend you are a gentleman.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael suddenly remembered when, as a child, Mary&#x2019;d once tossed him head over heels into an icy pond for nothing more than laughing at her new hairstyle. Of course, she&#x2019;d been younger then, and less prone to care what others thought of her public deportment. He wondered for a bare second if she would really cause a scene, but the icy gleam in her eye made him think better of finding out.<br> <br>With a grimace, Michael turned to the waiting girl, took her proffered hand, and held it the minimal time required by politeness before releasing it. &#x201c;Miss Latham,&#x201d; he intoned with as little enthusiasm as possible.<br> <br>Miss Latham beamed as if he&#x2019;d just conferred a cask of gold coins upon her. &#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d remember me. We spoke at length about the Rosetta stone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did we?&#x201d; he asked in a bored tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes! I&#x2019;ve read every word you&#x2019;ve ever written.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt that, unless you&#x2019;ve managed to sneak into my bedchamber and procure my diaries. I&#x2019;m fairly sure no one has read those but me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary murmured a protest under her breath, but he ignored her. <br> <br>Miss Latham&#x2019;s face turned several shades pinker and she tittered nervously. &#x201c;Oh, no! I would never, ever sneak into a man&#x2019;s bedchamber.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More&#x2019;s the pit&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael,&#x201d; Mary interjected hurriedly, shooting him a dagger glance before she offered a kind smile to the sublimely unaware Miss Latham. &#x201c;What my brother means to say is that The Morning Post serial is but a small portion of his writings. He&#x2019;s the author of many scientific treatises on various artifacts and ruins that he&#x2019;s unearthed, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My diaries,&#x201d; he said smoothly.<br> <br>One of the other girls&#x2014;they could hardly be called women, as they were gazing at him as if he were a sweet cake and they were ready to devour him&#x2014;clasped her hands together and said in a soulful tone, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known a man to keep a diary.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;And just how many men do you know?&#x201d; Michael asked, irritated to be placed upon a pedestal for the most mundane of things.<br> <br>Mary glared at him as if she were fighting the urge to toss him back into a pond. She said under her breath, &#x201c;No one will invite you anywhere if you continue like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; he assured her en sotto. &#x201c;They are too silly to know any better.&#x201d; <br> <br>As if to prove his point, yet another girl, this one with brown hair and a protruding chin, said brazenly, as if every word were a challenge that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to resist, &#x201c;Mr. Hurst, I daresay our petty little parties bore you to death.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, they do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not realizing he found their party boring because of inane comments like hers, she sent her companions a triumphant glance. &#x201c;I knew it! A ball is too tame for him after wrestling crocodiles and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold!&#x201d; Michael frowned. &#x201c;Did you say &#x2018;wrestling crocodiles&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, yes.&#x201d; When his brow creased, she added in a helpful tone, &#x201c;You wrote about it in the The Morning Post just last month.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary&#x2019;s hand slipped from where it had been resting on his arm. <br> <br>&#x201c;Pray excuse me for just one moment,&#x201d; Michael told the vapid ing�nue before he turned. <br> <br>His sister was two steps away, looking for a way to escape, but the crowd&#x2014;trying to get closer to hear him speak&#x2014;pressed too closely. <br> <br>He grasped her elbow and pulled her back to his side. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s never a trapdoor about when you most need one, is there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Face red, she glanced at their interested audience. With obvious effort, she fixed a frozen smile on her face. &#x201c;Pardon me, but my poor brother is famished and needs nourishment.&#x201d; With that, she locked her arm through his, turned on her heel, put down her head, and burrowed her way through the crowd.<br> <br>Michael allowed her to tug him along, glad to be rid of the pests in laces who stared after them.<br> <br>They reached the refreshment table, where Mary quickly selected two half-filled cups and grabbed a small plate upon which sat a tiny piece of stale cake. Then, with an air of determination, she found an alcove hidden from prying eyes. Once there, she let out a huge sigh and dropped wearily upon the small settee provided for those fatigued from dancing.<br> <br>&#x201c;A crocodile?&#x201d; Michael asked. &#x201c;What&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shush!&#x201d; She gestured for him to take a cup. &#x201c;Give me a moment to rest before you quiz me. I vow but I was holding my breath during that entire conversation. I just knew you&#x2019;d be rude and ruin all of our efforts.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael sniffed his cup and then took an exploratory sip. He choked. &#x201c;Bloody hell, what is this stuff?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Orgeat, which you&#x2019;d know if you&#x2019;d throw your mind back to the few dances Mother and I dragged you to as a youth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s vile.&#x201d; Michael dumped the contents of his cup into a nearby plant, and then reached into his pocket and pulled out a small silver flask. <br> <br>Mary paused, her own cup halfway to her lips. &#x201c;Scotch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. And damned good Scotch, too. Our beloved brother-in-law Hugh sent it to me.&#x201d; Michael filled his cup from his flask. &#x201c;I admired the MacLean stock while visiting Hugh and our sister Triona several years ago, and he sent me a case. I&#x2019;m almost to the end of it, so I may need to visit them again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps I need to visit them.&#x201d; Mary wistfully eyed his cup. &#x201c;Triona was sad not to join us here in London.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael paused in taking a drink. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised she hasn&#x2019;t yet been to town.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mam told her not to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s our grandmother to do with Triona&#x2019;s travel plans?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Triona&#x2019;s hoping to have a child and Mam specifically told her she should stay home just now and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold. Triona&#x2019;s following Mam&#x2019;s advice?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Our grandmother is a healer. A noted healer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Noted by a village full of uneducated fools.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary&#x2019;s gaze narrowed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s helped many people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Many people think she&#x2019;s helped them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that the same?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Mam&#x2019;s tendencies toward the flamboyant would have served her well upon the stage but do little to recommend her as a healer. If Triona and Hugh wish for a child, they would do better to come to London and see a physician.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Triona&#x2019;s already been to every physician in London and Edinburgh. She and Hugh even went to Italy to see someone and&#x2014;&#x201d; Mary frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already told you all of this in my letters. Didn&#x2019;t you read them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then what did I say about Triona and Hugh&#x2019;s efforts to have a child?&#x201d;<br> <br>He swirled the whiskey in his cup. <br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t read a single one of my letters, did you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I read them all; I just didn&#x2019;t read them closely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael!&#x201d; From where she sat on the low settee, Mary stomped her foot, her skirts fluttering. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a&#x2014; I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2014; Oh!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t read every damn word of every letter I get! I have five brothers and sisters, and then there&#x2019;s Father, who cannot let a day go by without sending me some preachy epistle, and Mother, who is determined to discover who I&#x2019;m to wed before I even know it myself. I didn&#x2019;t yet mention Mam, who writes such damned cryptic stuff that it&#x2019;s harder to slog through than a stone scratched over with hieroglyphs, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop complaining. You enjoy our letters and we know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was right. Though he may not have read the letters from his family closely each and every time he received one, he loved getting the missives. He traveled so much that they connected him to his home and kept him grounded. <br> <br>Truth be told, he owed his siblings a lot. If not for their efforts, he would still be trapped in a sulfi&#x2019;s prison. He shrugged and then smiled at Mary. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right; there were days your letters were my only light.&#x201d; More than you&#x2019;ll ever know.<br> <br>Mary eyed his flask. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;re thankful enough to share a sip, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>He handed her the flask, noting how she eagerly poured a liberal splash into her own cup. &#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s the sister I know and love,&#x201d; he said with fondness as he replaced the flask in his pocket.<br> <br>She took a sip and then sighed blissfully. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s wonderful. But you, Michael, are not. If you&#x2019;d read my letters you&#x2019;d know that Triona agreed to drink Mam&#x2019;s potions for one year, and if there is no child by that time, then Triona&#x2019;ll give up.&#x201d; <br> <br>Michael curled his lip. &#x201c;Potions. There is no such thing as magic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why are you so determined to get your hands on the Hurst Amulet? You&#x2019;ve seen written accounts that say it&#x2019;s magical.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve also seen written accounts vowing that the earth is flat.&#x201d; <br> <br>Mary held out her empty cup and gestured for Michael to refill it. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no harm in our sister drinking Mam&#x2019;s potions. They give Triona hope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;False hope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is better than none,&#x201d; Mary replied in a spritely tone, pointing at her waiting cup.<br> <br>Michael removed the flask from his pocket, unscrewed the top, and tipped it over her cup, before saying in a resigned tone, &#x201c;But I suppose Triona wouldn&#x2019;t listen to anyone else. Plus, there are benefits to keeping Mam preoccupied, for she&#x2019;ll be far too busy with our sister&#x2019;s business to interfere in our lives.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary frowned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve become very self-absorbed. Robert says it comes from being in charge of so many people for so long, and having your every wish seen to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Our brother is a fool. He makes it sound as if I had servant girls following me around, waving palm fronds and feeding me grapes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Michael, you didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t. Bloody hell, I&#x2019;ve been on an expedition, not a holiday. Instead of nattering on about something he knows nothing about, Robert should accompany me on my next expedition to Egypt. I&#x2019;d like to see his soft, lace-bedecked self sleeping upon a pallet under a mosquito net, working from dawn to sundown in stifling heat, and digging in the dirt for hours upon end.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you hired men to dig for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t let them dig without supervision. Besides, if it&#x2019;s a rich find, it&#x2019;s better to dig myself so that fewer artifacts are broken by careless shovels and picks.&#x201d; He cocked a brow at her. &#x201c;Speaking of carelessness . . .&#x201d; Michael tossed back the rest of his whiskey and refilled his cup. &#x201c;We really should discuss this crocodile I supposedly wrestled. You&#x2019;ve been wielding your pen far too artfully in &#x2018;my&#x2019; serial for The Morning Post.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You asked me to write the serial for you,&#x201d; she protested halfheartedly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only because I didn&#x2019;t have the time to do it myself, not because I wished someone to fabricate stories that make me appear ridiculous.&#x201d;<br> <br>She bit her lip, though she peeped at him through her lashes. &#x201c;I let you win.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he returned sarcastically. &#x201c;When I first arrived in ...</p><h2>Homestead, A Memoir</h2><p>Homestead is the true story of awarding winning author Jane Kirkpatrick.

Henrietta longs to see a few sights in the foreign city; little does she know what fascinating secrets the Fisher house itself contains.<br>For Henrietta finds that her visit coincides with that of Leopold, an intense child who has come to Paris to be introduced to the mother he has never known. In the course of a single day, the relations between Leopold, Henrietta's agitated hostess Naomi Fisher, Leopold's mysterious mother, his dead father, and the dying matriarch in bed upstairs, come to light slowly and tantalizingly. And when Henrietta leaves the house that evening, it is in possession of the kind of grave knowledge usually reserved only for adults.

Instead, she's the woman he can't forget. Now this brash billionaire will do anything for more...&nbsp;<br><br>Nick Messena has gone through his share of women in the past six years and still hasn't quelled his hunger for Elena Lyon. But on the night they made love, their families were plunged into a scandal that left Nick questioning everything. He thought he'd never have her again....&nbsp;<br><br>Now, a family secret has brought them back together...and Nick's sweet wallflower has bloomed into a breathtaking vixen! Nick wants Elena&#x2014;for one more night and then some! But can he convince her she's the only woman for him?</p><p>Fiona Brand lives in the sunny Bay of Islands, New Zealand. Now that both of her sons are grown, she continues to love writing books and gardening. After a life-changing time in which she met Christ, she has undertaken study for a bachelor of theology and has become a member of The Order of St. Luke, Christ&#39;s healing ministry.Elena Lyon would never get a man in her life until she surgically removed every last reminder of Nick Messena from hers!<br><br>Number one on her purge list was getting rid of the beach villa located in Dolphin Bay, New Zealand, in which she had spent one disastrous, passionate night with Messena.<br><br>As she strolled down one of Auckland's busiest streets, eyes peeled for the real estate agency she had chosen to handle the sale, a large sign emblazoned with the name Messena Construction shimmered into view, seeming to float in the brassy summer heat.<br><br>Automatic tension hummed, even though the likelihood that Nick, who spent most of his time overseas, was at the busy construction site was small.<br><br>Although, the sudden conviction that he was there, and watching her, was strong enough to stop her in her tracks.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, she dismissed the overreaction which was completely at odds with her usual calm precision and girded herself to walk past the brash, noisy work site. Gaze averted from a trio of bare-chested construction workers, Elena decided she couldn't wait to sell the beach villa. Every time she visited, it seemed to hold whispering echoes of the intense emotions that, six years ago, had been her downfall.<br><br>Emotions that hadn't appeared to affect the dark and dangerously unreliable CEO of Messena Construction in the slightest.<br><br>The rich, heady notes of a tango emanating from her handbag distracted Elena from an embarrassingly loud series of whistles and catcalls.<br><br>A breeze whipped glossy, dark tendrils loose from her neat French pleat as she retrieved the phone. Pushing her glasses a little higher on the delicate bridge of her nose, she peered at the number glowing on her screen.<br><br><i>Nick Messena.</i><br><br>Her heart slammed once, hard. The sticky heat and background hum of Friday afternoon traffic dissolved and she was abruptly transported back six years....<br><br><i>To the dim heat of what had then been her aunt Katherine's beach villa, tropical rain pounding on the roof. Nick Messena's muscular, tanned body sprawled heavily across hers-</i><br><br>Cheeks suddenly overwarm, she checked the phone, which had stopped ringing. A message flashed on the screen. She had voice mail.<br><br>Her jaw locked. It had to be a coincidence that Nick had rung this afternoon when she was planning one of her infrequent trips back to Dolphin Bay.<br><br>Her fingers tightened on the utilitarian black cell, the perfect no-nonsense match for her handbag. Out of the blue, Nick had started ringing her a week ago at her apartment in Sydney. Unfortunately, she had been off guard enough to actually pick up the first call, then mesmerized enough by the sexy timbre of his voice that she'd been incapable of slamming the phone down.<br><br>To make matters worse, somehow, she had ended up agreeing to meet him for dinner, as if the searing hours she'd spent locked in his arms all those years ago had never happened.<br><br>Of course, she hadn't gone, and she hadn't canceled, either. She had stood him up.<br><br>Behaving in such a way, without manners or consideration, had gone against the grain. But the jab of guilt had been swamped by a warming satisfaction that finally, six years on, Messena had gotten a tiny taste of the disappointment she had felt.<br><br>The screen continued to flash its message.<br><br><i>Don't listen. Just delete the message.</i><br><br>The internal directives came a split second too late. Her thumb had already stabbed the button that activated her voice mail.<br><br>Nick's deep, curt voice filled her ear, shooting a hot tingle down her spine and making her stomach clench.<br><br>This message was simple, his number and the same arrogant demand he'd left on her answerphone a number of times since their initial conversation: <i>Call me.</i><br><br>For a split second the busy street and the brassy glare of the sun glittering off cars dissolved in a red mist.<br><br>After six years? During which time he had utterly ignored her existence and the fact that he had ditched her after just one night.<br><br><i>Like that was going to happen.</i><br><br>Annoyed with herself for being weak enough to listen to the message, she dropped the phone back into her purse and stepped off the curb. No matter how much she had once wanted Nick to call, she had never fallen into the trap of chasing after a man she knew was not interested in her personally.<br><br>To her certain knowledge Nick Messena had only ever wanted two things from her. Lately, it was the recovery of a missing ring that Nick had mistakenly decided his father had gifted to her aunt. A scenario that resurrected the scandalous lie that her aunt Katherine-the Messena family's housekeeper-had been engaged in a steamy affair with Stefano Messena, Nick's father.<br><br>Six years ago, Nick's needs had been a whole lot simpler: he had wanted sex.<br><br>The blast of a car horn jerked her attention back to the busy street. Adrenaline rocketing through her veins, Elena hurried out of the path of a bus and stepped into the air-conditioned coolness of an exclusive mall.<br><br>She couldn't believe how stupid she had been to walk across a busy street without taking careful note of the traffic. Almost as stupid as she'd been six years ago on her birthday when she'd been lonely enough to break every personal rule she'd had and agree to a blind date.<br><br>The date, organized by so-called friends, had turned out to be with Messena, the man she'd had a hopeless crush on for most of her teenage years.<br><br>At age twenty-two, with a double degree in business and psychology, she should have been wary of such an improbable situation. Messena had been hot and in demand. With her long dark hair and creamy skin, and her legs-her best feature-she had been passable. But with her propensity to be just a little plump, she hadn't been in Messena's league.<br><br>Despite knowing that, her normal common sense had let her down. She had made the fatal mistake of believing in the heated gleam in Nick's gaze and the off-the-register passion. She had thought that Messena, once branded a master of seduction by one notorious tabloid, was sincere.<br><br>Heart still pumping too fast, she strolled through the rich, soothing interior of the mall, which, as luck would have it, was the one that contained the premises for Coastal Realty.<br><br>The receptionist-a lean, elegant redhead-showed her into Evan Cutler's office.<br><br>Cutler, who specialized in waterfront developments and central city apartments, shot to his feet as she stepped through the door. Shadow and light flickered over an expanse of dove-gray carpet, alerting Elena to the fact that Cutler wasn't the sole occupant of the room.<br><br>A second man, large enough to block the sunlight that would otherwise have flooded through a window, turned, his black jacket stretched taut across broad shoulders, his tousled dark hair shot through with lighter streaks that gleamed like hot gold.<br><br>A second shot of adrenaline zinged through her veins. <i>"You."</i><br><br>Nick Messena. Six feet two inches of sleekly muscled male, with a firm jaw and the kind of clean, chiseled cheekbones that still made her mouth water.<br><br>He wasn't male-model perfect. Despite the fact that he was a wealthy businessman, somewhere along the way he had gotten a broken nose and a couple of nicks on one cheekbone. The battered, faintly dangerous look, combined with a dark five-o'clock shadow-and that wicked body-and there was no doubting he was potent. A dry, low-key charm and a reputation with women that scorched, and Nick was officially hot.<br><br>Her stomach sank when she noticed the phone in his hand.<br><br>Eyes a light, piercing shade of green, clashed with hers. "And you didn't pick up my call, because...?"<br><br>The low, faintly gravelly rasp of his voice, as if he had just rolled out of a tangled, rumpled bed, made her stomach tighten. "I was busy."<br><br>"I noticed. You should check the street before you cross."<br><br>Fiery irritation canceled out her embarrassment and other more disturbing sensations that had coiled in the pit of her stomach. Positioned at the window, Nick would have had a clear view of her walking down the street as he had phoned. "Since when have you been so concerned about my welfare?"<br><br>He slipped the phone into his jacket pocket. "Why wouldn't I be? I've known you and your family most of my life."<br><br>The easy comment, as if their families were on friendly terms and there hadn't been a scandal, as if he hadn't slept with her, made her bristle. "I guess if anything happened to me, you might not get what you want."<br><br>The second the words were out Elena felt ashamed. As ruffled and annoyed as she was by Nick, she didn't for a moment think he was that cold and calculating. If the assertion that her aunt and Stefano Messena had been having an affair when they were killed in a car accident, <i>the same night she and Nick had made love,</i> had hurt the Lyon family, it went without saying it had hurt the Messenas.<br><br>Her jaw tightened at Nick's lightning perusal of her olive-green dress and black cotton jacket, and the way his attention lingered on her one and only vice, her shoes. The clothes were designer labels and expensive, but she was suddenly intensely aware that the dark colors in the middle of summer looked dull and boring. Unlike the shoes, which were strappy and outrageously feminine, the crisp tailoring and straight lines were more about hiding curves than displaying them.<br><br>Nick's gaze rested briefly on her mouth. "And what is it, exactly, that you think I want?"<br><br>A question that shouldn't be loaded, but suddenly was, made her breath hitch in her throat. Although the thought that Nick could possibly have any personal interest in her now was ridiculous.<br><br>And she was absolutely not interested in him. Despite the hot looks, <i>GQ</i> style and killer charm, he had a blunt, masculine toughness that had always set her subtly on edge.<br><br>Although she could never allow herself to forget that, through some weird alchemy, that same quality had once cut through her defenses like a hot knife through butter. "I already told you I have no idea where your lost jewelry is."<br><br>"But you are on your way back to Dolphin Bay."<br><br>"I have better reasons for going there than looking for your mythical lost ring." She lifted her chin, abruptly certain that Nick's search for the ring, something that the female members of his family could have done, was a ploy and that he had another, shadowy, agenda. Although what that agenda could be, she had no clue. "More to the point, how did you find out I would be here?"<br><br>"You haven't been returning my calls, so I rang Zane."<br><br>Her annoyance level increased another notch that Nick had intruded even further into her life by calling his cousin, and her boss, Zane Atraeus. "Zane is in Florida."<br><br>Nick's expression didn't alter. "Like I said, you haven't returned my calls, and you didn't turn up for our...appointment in Sydney. You left me no choice."<br><br>Elena's cheeks warmed at his blunt reference to the fact that she had failed to meet him for what had sounded more like a date than a business meeting at one of Sydney's most expensive restaurants.<br><br>She had never in her life missed an appointment, or even been late for one, but the idea that Nick's father had paid her aunt off with jewelry, <i>the standard currency for a mistress,</i> had been deeply insulting. "I told you over the phone, I don't believe your father gave Aunt Katherine anything. Why would he?"<br><br>His expression was oddly neutral. "They were having an affair."<br><br>She made an effort to control the automatic fury that gripped her at Nick's stubborn belief that her aunt had conducted a sneaky, underhanded affair with her employer.<br><br>Quite apart from the fact that her aunt had considered Nick's mother, Luisa Messena, to be her friend, she had been a woman of strong morals. And there was one powerful, abiding reason her aunt would never have gotten involved with Stefano, or any man.<br><br>Thirty years ago Katherine Lyon had fallen in love, completely, irrevocably, and he had <i>died.</i><br><br>In the Lyon family the legend of Katherine's unrequited love was well respected. Lyons were not known for being either passionate or tempestuous. They were more the steady-as-you-go type of people who tended to choose solid careers and marry sensibly. In days gone by they had been admirable servants and thrifty farmers. Unrequited love, or love lost in any form was a novelty.<br><br>Elena didn't know who Aunt Katherine's lover had been because her aunt had point-blank refused to talk about him. All she knew was that her aunt, an exceptionally beautiful woman, had remained determinedly single and had stated she would never love again.<br><br>Elena's fingers tightened on the strap of her handbag. "No. They were not having an affair. Lyon women are not, and never have been, the playthings of wealthy men."<br><br>Cutler cleared his throat. "I see you two have met."<br><br>Elena turned her gaze on the real estate agent, who was a small, balding man with a precise manner. There were no confusing shades with Cutler, which was why she had chosen him. He was factual and efficient, attributes she could relate to in her own career as a personal assistant.<br><br>Although, it seemed the instant she had any contact with Nick Messena, her usual calm, methodical process evaporated and she found herself plunged into the kind of passionate emotional excess that was distinctly un-Lyon-like. "We're acquainted."<br><br>Nick's brows jerked together. "I seem to remember it was a little more than that."<br><br>Elena gave up the attempt to avoid the confrontation Nick was angling for and glared back. "If you were a gentleman, you wouldn't mention the past."<br><br>"As I recall from a previous conversation, I'm no gentleman."<br><br>Elena blushed at his reference to the accusation she had flung at him during a chance meeting in Dolphin Bay, a couple of months after their one night together. That he was arrogant and ruthless and emotionally incapable of sustaining a relationship. "I don't see why I should help drag the Lyon name through the mud one more time just because you want to get your hands on some clunky old piece of jewelry you've managed to lose."<br><br>His brows jerked together. "I didn't lose anything, and you already know that the missing piece of jewelry is a diamond ring."<br><br>And knowing the Messena family and their extreme wealth, the diamond would be large, breathtakingly expensive and probably old. "Aunt Katherine would have zero interest in a diamond ring. In case you didn't notice, she was something of a feminist and she almost never wore jewelry. Besides, if she was having a <i>secret</i> affair with your father, what possible interest would she have in wearing an expensive ring that proclaimed that fact?"<br><br>Nick's gaze cooled perceptibly. "Granted. Nevertheless, the ring is gone."<br><br>Cutler cleared his throat and gestured that she take a seat. "Mr. Messena has expressed interest in the villa you've inherited in Dolphin Bay. He proposed a swap with one of his new waterfront apartments here in Auckland, which is why I invited him to this meeting."<br><br>Elena suppressed her knee-jerk desire to say that, as keen as she was to sell, there was no way she would part with the villa to a Messena. "That's very interesting," she said smoothly. "But at the moment I'm keeping my options open."</p><h2>Flight of the Intruder</h2><p><i>A smash bestseller that spent over six months on the </i>New York Times<i> bestseller list, </i>FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER<i> became an instant classic. No one before or since ever captured the world of Navy carrier pilots with the gripping realism of </i><i>Vietnam</i><i> veteran Stephen Coonts, who lived the life he wrote about. More than a flying story, </i>FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER<i> is also one of the best novels ever written about the </i><i>Vietnam</i><i> experience. It's all here--the flying, the dying, the blood and bombs and bullets, and the sheer joy--and terror--of life at full throttle.</i><br><br><b>"GRIPPING...SMASHING."?<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br>Grazing the Vietnam treetops at night at just under the speed of sound, A-6 Intruder pilot Jake "Cool Hand" Grafton knows exactly how precarious life is. Landing on a heaving aircraft carrier, dodging missiles locked on his fighter, flying through clouds of flak--he knows each flight could be his last. Yet he straps himself into a cockpit every day. <b></b><br><br><b>"EXTRAORDINARY!"--<i>Tom Clancy</i></b><br>Then a bullet kills his bombardier while they're hitting another 'suspected' truck depot. Jake wonders what his friend died for--and why? Hitting pointless targets selected by men piloting desks just doesn't make sense. Maybe it's time to do something worthwhile. Something that will make a difference... <br><br><b>"SUPERBLY WRITTEN."?<i>Washington Times</i></b><br>Jake and his new bombardier, ice-cold Tiger Cole, are going to pick their own target and hit the enemy where it hurts. But to get there and back in one piece is going to take a lot of nerve, even more skill, and an incredible amount of raw courage. Before it's over, they're going to fly into hell. <br><br><b>"When Grafton is at the controls of his Intruder, the novel comes alive with a jolt."</b><br><b>?<i>Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><br></p><p><b>Stephen Coonts </b>is the author of <i>The Disciple, The Assassin</i>, and the Deep Black and Saucers series, among many other bestsellers. His first novel, the classic flying tale <i>Flight of the Intruder</i>, spent more than six months at the top of the<i> New York Times </i>bestseller list. A motion picture based on the book was released in 1991. His novels have been published around the world and translated into more than a dozen languages. In 1986, he was honored by the U.S. Naval Institute with its Author of the Year Award. He is also the editor of four anthologies, Combat, On Glorious Wings, Victory and War in the Air. Coonts served in the Navy from 1969 to 1977, including two combat cruises on the USS Enterprise during the last years of the Vietnam War.With this well-crafted first novel, the publishers of The Hunt for Red October again demonstrate a sure eye for picking winners in the thriller genre. Jake Grafton is an A-6 Intruder pilot during the Vietnam War who flies his bomber on sorties past enemy flak and SAM missiles, and then must maneuver his plane, often at night, onto the relatively small deck of an aircraft carrier. Former Navy flyer Coonts gives an excellent sense of the complexities of modern air raids and how nerve-wracking it is, even for the best airmen, to technically solve sudden problems over and over, knowing that even a twist of fatea peasant wildly firing a rifle from a fieldcould wipe out the crew. Grafton alternates between remorse over the fate of his unseen Vietnamese victims on the ground and a gung-ho "let's win this war" sentiment that lashes at both policymakers who select less-than-important targets for the dangerous missions and advocates for peace back in the States.

Sunk off the southern coast of Ireland by a torpedo fired from the German submarine <i>U-20</i>, she exploded and sank in eighteen minutes, taking with her some twelve hundred people, more than half of the passengers and crew.

It is a critical chapter in the progress of World War I and in the political biographies of Woodrow Wilson, William Jennings Bryan, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill.

In this swiftly paced reconstruction, Diana Preston examines the events of that day and its aftermath--and hints at some tantalizing secrets. Among other things, the sinking of the Lusitania and the death of scores of American passengers helped draw the United States into World War I. Yet, Preston observes, it was no sneak attack; the German government had gone out of its way to warn prospective passengers that the English ship, as a military reserve vessel, was a fair target. And for good reason, though the Germans may not have known it; Preston suggests that it may well have been carrying armaments, which does much to explain why the British government suppressed a fact-finding inquest following the sinking. Whatever the truth, the destruction of the Lusitania had far-reaching effects--not least of them the Kaiser's ordering a stop to unrestricted submarine warfare. Preston's richly detailed, highly readable history sheds new light on the incident and the conduct of modern war. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p>"This is the most comprehensive account of the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> that I have ever seen.

If it is, then it is thanks to the valued works and even more valuable support of a host of writers who recognized that bookstores are more than places to sell their wares. Bookstores can be the soul of a neighborhood, the heart of a city. There are places with resident cats (like Brooklyn&#x2019;s Community Bookstore) and places without (Birmingham&#x2019;s Alabama Booksmith). Places where three-year-olds can cajole the owner into opening early, and others where fledgling writers find solace and inspiration.

At their head, says Creme, is Maitreya, the World Teacher, the one awaited under different names by people of all spiritual traditions.</p><p> Creme covers topics both profound and practical, ranging from mankind's origin to the principle of sharing as the first step toward global peace; from meditation and service to the technology of light; from reincarnation and karma to a pollution-free environment. A section on miracles explains the source and purpose of weeping Madonnas, crosses of light, healing waters, "milk-drinking" statues, crop circles and more.</p><p> Benjamin Creme's message holds a unique place in today's world. It offers a practical application of the ancient wisdom underlying all faiths. It provides the blueprint for a society that offers the basic necessities of life to all. It is the assurance of a hard-won but glorious future for humanity. "The new millennium is not the end," says Creme, "but rather a hopeful new beginning."</p></p><p>A lifelong student of the Ageless Wisdom teachings -- first made available to the public in the late 1800s by H.P. Blavatsky and later by Alice A. Bailey -- Benjamin Creme has traveled the world for more than 30 years informing people that the greatest event in history is now unfolding. <i>Humanity's Elder Brothers -- the Masters of Wisdom -- are once again among us.</i> Soon these ancient guardians of the human race will be working openly at our side, showing us how to live together in peace -- with sharing, justice and Earth stewardship as the keynotes of a new civilization. In the 16 inspiring and provocative books which have emerged from his lectures, Creme paints an ever more detailed picture of humanity's destiny, both worldly and spiritually. "We are talking about nothing less than the total transformation of every aspect of our lives", he says. Creme's message is both profound and immensely practical. Each book covers a vast range of topics: from meditation and the growth of consciousness to political and economic change, from initiation and group work to ecology and world service. Compelling explanations are offered for the ever-increasing 'miraculous' or unexplained phenomena such as weeping Madonnas, crosses of light, healing waters, crop circles and UFOs. Creme also clarifies misunderstandings about the antichrist and the 'last judgment' .<br> Benjamin Creme is chief editor of <i>Share International</i>, a monthly magazine read in over 70 countries that addresses the changes that are both needed and actually occuring in every field of endeavor to bring about a more just and compassionate global society. He accepts no remuneration or royalties for his work.<b>EXCERPT FROM THE PREFACE</b><br> by Benjamin Creme<p> Humanity today is living at a unique time in its history. The events that I submit are now under way will transform our lives, our world, in the most fundamental, radical fashion, within a relatively short number of years. We are at the end of a civilization, and therefore at the beginning of a new one: if we would have it so, this can be the most brilliant in our long history.</p><p> Most people will know that we are entering a new era, a new cosmic cycle. We call it the Age of Aquarius because of the particular relationship now being formed in space between our solar system and the constellation of Aquarius. In its cyclic movement around the heavens, our solar system has come into a definite energetic alignment with that constellation, which will continue for the next 2,350 years, more or less. This alignment causes the Earth to become saturated with the cosmic energies of Aquarius. Every civilization, beginning roughly every 2,000 years, is the result of this changing cosmic relationship. </p><p> As we near the end of the century, a powerful thoughtform of destruction is gripping the minds of millions of people. Throughout the world there is a "doomsday complex." As a result of misunderstanding the prognostications of people like Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus and others, people have the idea that towards the end of the century there will be some great catastrophic event in which the world will be physically changed: mountains will rise and many countries, perhaps continents, will sink under the sea. This belief is widespread and it comes largely from a misunderstanding of history and of scriptures which seem to point to such an apocalyptic end to the world. </p><p> As we enter a new age, everything changes. Political, economic, religious and social forms inevitably change under the impact of the new, powerful, cosmic energies that enter our lives. The foretold destruction I believe is altogether exaggerated. Countries will not go under the oceans. The oceans will not rise as mountains. The cataclysm which has been foretold by so many, emanating in the main from the astral planes--the planes of illusion--has little foundation in fact. Change there will be, but change for the better. </p><p> We are about to enter an era in which the innate spiritual nature of humanity will begin to express itself in a mass form. Countless millions throughout the world will awaken to the true purpose of their lives. A deeper, more soundly-based attitude to life will develop and people will recognize themselves as souls--souls in incarnation. They will come to understand the purpose of their incarnation, and, more and more, they will take a conscious part in their own evolution, creating modes of freedom and justice which this world has never before seen. Freedom and justice, and therefore peace, will allow the divine, spiritual aspect of humanity to come to the fore and be given expression, not only as a religious experience, but in every department of life. In politics, economics and education, in art and science, the inner awareness of our spiritual nature will increasingly be demonstrated. This will allow the discovery of a science, and the control over the forces of nature, which will give humanity unlimited power over its environment. </p><p> All of this awaits us as we enter the new cycle. Far from destruction, we shall enter an era of unprecedented creativity and beauty of life. And this in large measure because of the re-entry into our lives of a group of men without fault, spiritual giants--from our point of view, perfected men. These are men who have gone ahead of us in evolution, and have completed the journey on which we are still engaged. They need no longer live on this planet, but accept the responsibility of remaining here to guide the rest of us to that same perfection. They have many names: the Great White Brotherhood, the Society of Illumined Minds, the Elder Brothers of humanity, the Teachers, the Guides, the Mahatmas, the Masters of Wisdom and the Lords of Compassion. </p><p> Cycle after cycle, one of these Great Ones has come into the world to teach humanity the way forward, the next step in our evolution to perfection ... Some 2,600 years ago, Gautama Buddha prophesied that at the beginning of this cycle there would come into the world another great teacher, a Buddha like Himself, by name Maitreya. Maitreya, He said, would inspire humanity to create a brilliant golden civilization based, as He put it, on Righteousness and Truth. In June 1945--significantly at the end of the Second World War--the Lord Maitreya announced His intention to return to the world at the earliest possible moment, if humanity would take the first steps to put its house in order. He said He would come when a measure of peace had been restored to the world; when the principle of sharing was beginning to govern economic affairs; and when the energy of goodwill, the lowest aspect of love, was manifesting, and leading to the establishment of right human relationships ... This event would be the externalization of the activity of the Masters for the first time in nearly 100,000 years.</p></p><h2>Deadly Embrace</h2><p>Family secrets and hidden lives come to haunt Madison Castelli, the sexy, vivacious, and talented writer last seen in Jackie Collins's Lethal Seduction. As she digs into her father's past, trying to resolve the mystery that surrounds her mother's death many years before, Madison finds herself falling into a vortex of lust, greed, and deception, as eventually her quest of discovery turns into a race for her life.

She'd planned on going straight to her best friend, Natalie De Barge's, house. However, Natalie had informed her they were meeting Natalie's brother, Cole, in a restaurant at eight, and since the plane was so late, Madison decided she'd better go directly to Mario's -- a small Italian restaurant on Beverly Boulevard. </p><p> "I'll see you there," she said, speaking to Natalie on her cell phone as she strode through the airport. </p><p> She was looking forward to getting together with her friends. The truth was that she couldn't wait to hash out the ruins of her life. Over the last few days everything had fallen to pieces. Her father, Michael, was being accused of a double murder. His estranged wife, Stella (Madison's stepmother), and Stella's live-in lover had been shot, execution style. Now there was a warrant out for Michael's arrest, and he'd managed to mysteriously vanish. </p><p> As if that weren't enough to worry about, her boyfriend, Jake, was also on the missing list. Her wonderful, sexy, smart Jake -- an ace photographer who'd been covering a drug cartel in Colombia with a couple of colleagues -- had not been heard from in ten days, which was pretty damn worrying. Kidnapping was rife in Colombia, and so was murder. </p><p> All of this was on her mind as she collected her luggage, hailed a cab, and headed for the restaurant. This visit west was exactly what she needed to get her head straight. A few days of hanging with her friends, doing nothing, was her plan. No work. No hassles. And then she'd fly back to New York refreshed and ready to deal with anything. </p><p> Cole was already at the restaurant when she arrived. A personal trainer, Cole was an extremely good-looking, tall black man in his twenties, with a well-toned, powerful physique and a killer smile. He was also gay, and proud of it. </p><p> They kissed and hugged. "You're lookin' hot, babe," Cole said, checking her out. </p><p> "Not me," she said ruefully. "And <i>you're</i> sounding very L.A." </p><p> "Could be 'cause I live here," he said, escorting her to their table in the corner. </p><p> "So <i>that's</i> how the men in L.A. speak to their women," she teased. </p><p> "No," he said, grinning. "That's how <i>I</i> speak to the <i>guys</i> -- keeps 'em comin', if you get my meaning." </p><p> "You'll have to teach me," she said, sitting down. </p><p> Madison, at thirty, was a striking-looking woman -- tall and slender, with full breasts, a small waist, and exceptionally long legs. </p><p> She usually attempted to play down her good looks, but her green, almond-shaped eyes, sharply defined cheekbones, full seductive lips, and clouds of black hair marked her as a beauty. A very smart beauty, because she was a well-respected journalist, who specialized in insightful profiles of the rich, famous, and powerful. She worked for a magazine called <i>Manhattan Style,</i> she'd recently had a book about relationships published, and she was currently working on an investigative piece about old, notorious New York crime families. Over the last year she'd discovered that her father's past wasn't exactly the way it seemed. In fact, she wasn't sure she knew him at all. She'd decided that if she wanted to find out the real truth, she had to dig for it. </p><p> "Where's Natalie?" she asked, glancing at her watch. </p><p> "Late as usual," Cole responded. "What else is new?" </p><p> "I miss her," Madison said wistfully. </p><p> "She misses you, too. It's a real shame you don't live in the same city. Think of the trouble you two could get into." </p><p> "How's her radio show going?" </p><p> "It's a big deal. She loves puttin' her voice out there. You know our Natalie -- gets off on the attention." </p><p> Minutes later, Natalie rushed in, looking glowingly pretty as usual. She was short and sassy, with a curvaceous body and luscious lips. "Sorry, sorry, sorry!" she exclaimed, grabbing Madison in a bear hug. "Gettin' out of the studio was a total nightmare. Wow!" she added, flopping into a chair. <i>"I</i> need a drink." </p><p> "Me too," Madison agreed, signaling a waiter. </p><p> The waiter came over. He was slight of build and very Italian looking, with shaggy black hair and an appealing accent. </p><p> "Wine," Natalie said. "I'm desperate." </p><p> "Red or white, signora?" </p><p> "House red for everyone." </p><p> "Good idea," Madison said. </p><p> The waiter hurried off. </p><p> "Hmmm...," Natalie said to his retreating back. "Nice booty." </p><p> "Yeah, <i>I</i> noticed that," Cole said. "Wonder what team he plays on." </p><p> "Mine!" claimed Natalie. "I can always tell." </p><p> "I wouldn't be too sure," Cole said, grinning. </p><p> "You two!" Madison exclaimed. "Nobody's safe around either of you." </p><p> "That's not true," Natalie objected. "Old people, and anyone under fifteen." </p><p> "Shocking!" Madison scolded. </p><p> "No, merely <i>honest,"</i> Natalie said. </p><p> Suddenly their attention was taken by a huge commotion at the front desk. </p><p> "What the hell is goin' on?" Natalie said, peering over. </p><p> "Dunno," Cole replied. </p><p> And then the unthinkable happened. Three men burst into the center of the restaurant brandishing guns. "Don'tcha move, assholes, or I'll blow your mothafuckin' heads off." The chilling words, yelled by a ski-masked male holding an Uzi machine gun, immediately silenced the busy restaurant. </p><p> Madison stared at them in disbelief. It had been a tough week, and now <i>this.</i> No <i>way.</i> This couldn't possibly be happening. </p><p> But it was. Mario's was under siege, and they were right in the middle of it as the three armed bandits, dressed all in black, with face-and-head-covering knit ski masks, commandeered the room, blocking the exit and the entrance to the kitchen. </p><p> "Jesus <i>Christ!"</i> Cole muttered, while Natalie sat perfectly still, frozen with fear. </p><p> Madison knew why. Ten years ago, when they were college roommates, Natalie had experienced a traumatic gang rape. She'd gotten over it and gone on to succeed in her profession as a celebrity interviewer -- now this random holdup had put her into shock. </p><p> "Stay cool, both of you," Cole warned. He was ready to deal with anything, although even <i>he</i> knew it wasn't smart to argue with a gun. </p><p> Automatically Madison leaned over to comfort Natalie, murmuring, "I don't believe this," as she pushed back her long dark hair, her green eyes darting around the room, her journalist's mind taking in every detail. </p><p> "You'd better believe it," Cole said in a low voice. "This is L.A. Shit happens." </p><p> "Shut the fuck up!" yelled the leader, the one with the Uzi. He was nervous and jumpy, moving around on the balls of his sneaker-shod feet like a stoned runner at the end of a particularly invigorating race. </p><p> Madison noticed his eyes staring at them through the slits in his mask. They were angry eyes, filled with undisguised hate. She reckoned he was young, probably still in his teens. </p><p> Young, agitated, and pissed off at the world. Just what they needed. </p><p> "Empty your fuckin' purses, take off your jewelry, an' do it now!" he screamed. </p><p> A second bandit, armed with a handgun and a crumpled black garbage bag, began running from table to table collecting money, wallets, watches, rings, cell phones, anything of value, while the third masked man herded the kitchen staff into the center of the room. </p><p> Madison willed herself to remain calm, but her heart was already pounding. She had no desire to be a victim; she was in the mood to do something, <i>anything</i> -- not just sit there and hand over her stuff like an obedient sheep. </p><p> The elderly woman at the table next to them was attempting to remove her pearl necklace. Her hands were shaking so much that she couldn't quite manage it. The younger woman with her leaned over and tried to help. </p><p> <i>Whack!</i> The bandit collecting the loot hit the younger woman in the face with the butt of his pistol. She slumped over, blood pumping from a vicious cut to her temple. </p><p> "Oh my God!" gasped the elderly woman. "What have you done to my daughter!" </p><p> Madison couldn't help herself; it was an unprovoked act of violence and she wasn't about to stand for it. "Coward," she hissed at the ski-masked robber. "Big man with a gun in your hand." </p><p> "Don't go there," Cole managed, his voice an urgent command. "Stay cool -- stay quiet." </p><p> Too late. The guy turned on Madison, waving his gun recklessly in her face. "Keep outta my business, ho, an' gimme your watch." He jerked his gun toward Natalie. "You too." </p><p> Natalie was still frozen to the spot, her brown eyes wide with fear. </p><p> "Give him your watch, Nat," Madison urged in what she hoped was a calm and steady voice. </p><p> Natalie didn't move. </p><p> "Come on, sweetie, do it," Madison cajoled. </p><p> Natalie still didn't move. </p><p> Without warning, the gunman grabbed Natalie's arm, tearing the gold Cartier watch off her wrist. </p><p> Natalie screamed, a loud, piercing scream that almost drowned out the sound of police sirens in the distance. </p><p> "Motha<i>fucker!"</i> yelled the leader, turning on Cole, eyes glinting dangerously through the slits in his mask. "Which one a you shit-ass fucks called the cops?" </p><p> "Hey, man," Cole said evenly. "Don't look at <i>me."</i> </p><p> As he spoke, the burly-looking man at the next table made his move, suddenly producing a pistol from under his jacket and aiming it at the ringleader. </p><p> "Drop your weapon," the man commanded in a salty voice. "Give it up now before you get into even more trouble." </p><p> For a second, Madison thought the ringleader was about to comply and instruct the other two to do the same. But no -- even though the lights of police cars now flashed outside the shuttered front windows, he was not prepared to give up. "Drop <i>your</i> fuckin' weapon," he sneered. "Or you got any fuckin' idea what <i>I'm</i> gonna do?" </p><p> The burly man stood his ground. He was a retired detective ready to make his final stab at being a hero, and no punk with a gun was about to stop him. "Listen, sonny, don't be dumb -- ," he began in a patronizing tone with the slightest hint of an Irish accent. </p><p> The word "dumb" triggered immediate action from the gunman, who let loose with a sudden burst of gunfire. Everyone screamed. The burly man fell to the ground, a look of complete surprise on his face. </p><p> "Who th' fuck's dumb now?" sneered the leader, waving the Uzi threateningly around the room. "Not <i>me!"</i> </p><p> Then he began yelling at his two cohorts to lock the doors and get everyone into the center of the restaurant. </p><p> "Christ!" Cole muttered. "We're screwed." </p><p> And Madison had a gut feeling he was right. </p><p><br> <b>Las Vegas</b> </p><p> Vincent Castle watched his pretty wife, Jenna, through hooded eyes. Jenna wasn't merely pretty. She was a true peach, with soft-as-satin skin, natural honey blond shoulder-length hair, wide-apart pale blue eyes, real breasts, and extraordinarily long legs. </p><p> Vincent was no slouch in the looks department himself -- six feet three inches tall, with dark curly hair, intense black eyes, a straight nose, dimpled chin, and worked-out body. Women creamed themselves over Vincent Castle. Not only was he a partner in the extremely successful Castle Hotel and Casino, he was also hot, and rich, and still only thirty-six. But unfortunately for the women who continually circled this fine prospect, he was married to the delectable Jenna. </p><p> And even more of an obstacle, he was faithful. </p><p> Of course, they had not been married a year yet, so there was still time. </p><p> "Jenna seems happy tonight," the woman sitting next to Vincent in the red leather booth said in a sly, seductive voice, placing an elegant hand on his thigh. Her name was Jolie Sanchez, and she was the wife of Vincent's business partner and childhood friend, Nando. Jolie was also a beauty. In her early thirties, she had catlike amber eyes, turned-down sensual lips, and long raven hair. </p><p> Vincent knew that if he wanted to, he could avail himself of everything she had to offer. </p><p> He didn't, because other men's wives were not his style, and he would certainly never go near his partner's wife. Besides, Nando -- who was half Colombian and half French -- had an out-of-control temper. He'd once cut off the ear of a rival he believed had screwed him in a deal. Unfortunately, the man had almost bled to death, causing Nando to think three times before losing his violent temper again. </p><p> "She admires movie stars," Vincent said, casually shifting his leg so that Jolie was forced to move her hand. </p><p> "Ah, but no movie star is as gorgeous as her husband," Jolie murmured, flattering him, which was her way. </p><p> Vincent gave a thin smile, keeping his rising anger under control. Jenna was disrespecting him, the way she was draping herself all over Andy Dale -- a one-hit movie wonder with lank dirty blond hair and a boyish grin. Andy Dale was in town for the big fight taking place the following night. He was accompanied by Anais, a surly black supermodel who was quite obviously coked out of her head and couldn't care less <i>who</i> he came on to. Nando had invited them for dinner and then promptly left, making the excuse that he had a business meeting. </p><p> Lately Vincent was beginning to wonder if he'd made a wrong move marrying Jenna. She was a very young twenty-two-year-old and surprisingly inexperienced. Unlike him. He'd covered the waterfront, exactly the way his father, Michael, had taught him to. At the age of seventeen, Michael had set him up with a twenty-year-old call girl in a suite at the MGM Grand for twenty-four hours, all expenses paid. What a deal! What a dad! </p><p> The young girl had taught him everything he was supposed to know about pleasing a woman, and although at the time he had not appreciated sticking his tongue between her legs and eating her out, he'd soon learned how much girls got off on it. </p><p> "Good looks are not what's gonna get you places," his father had lectured him. "You have to be the fastest an' the smartest in business, <i>and</i> you gotta know how to treat a woman in bed. That way you'll have the world by the balls. Believe me, son, <i>that's</i> what makes a man." </p><p> Michael Castelli was a man who did indeed have the world by the balls. Vincent looked up to him -- in spite of the fact that Michael had never married Dani, Vincent's mom. </p><p> Vincent had not yet heard about the arrest warrant and his father's disappearance. He was hardly in contact with his half sister, Madison -- whom he'd only met once, several months ago, under strained circumstances. Michael had called him up and said he needed a favor. Naturally, Vincent had obliged. </p><p> It galled him that Madison had no clue about Michael's other family. How come <i>he'd</i> been told the truth, and yet <i>she'd</i> led some kind of sheltered life, believing she was an only child? </p><p> Well, she wasn't. There was him and his younger sister, Sofia.

Maybe it's the fact that J.K. Rowling doesn't write children's books, she writes children's stories, more in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm than Dr. Seuss. The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted. Engaging for children without being childish, the audio version of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is worthy addition to the deservedly popular series. (Running time: 9 hours, 7 CDs) <i>--Andrew Nieland</i>The Dursleys were so mean that hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. <br>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. <br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><h2>Ignorance</h2><p>In Ignorance, set in contemporary Prague, one of the most distinguished writers of our time takes up the complex and emotionally charged theme of exile and creates from it a literary masterpiece. A man and a woman meet by chance while returning to their homeland, which they had abandoned twenty years earlier when they chose to become exiles. Will they manage to pick up the thread of their strange love story, interrupted almost as soon as it began and then lost in the tides of history The truth is that after such a long absence &#39;their memories no longer match.&#39; We always believe that our memories coincide with those of the person we loved, that we experienced the same thing. But this is just an illusion as the memory records only &#39;an insignificant, minuscule particle&#39; of the past, &#39;and no one knows why it&#39;s this bit and not any other bit.&#39; We live our lives sunk in a vast forgetting, and we refuse to see it. Only those who return after twenty years, like Ulysses returning to his native Ithaca, can be dazzled and astounded by observing the goddess of ignorance first-hand. Milan Kundera has taken these dizzying concepts of absence, memory, forgetting, and ignorance, and transformed them into material for a novel, masterfully orchestrating them into a polyphonic and moving work.</p><p>Bypassing the question of whether you can ever go home again, Milan Kundera's <i>Ignorance</i> tackles instead what happens when you actually get there. <i>Ignorance</i> is the story of two Czechs who meet by chance while traveling back to their homeland after 20 years in exile. Irena, who fled the country in 1968 with her now-deceased husband Martin, returns to Prague only to find coldness and indifference on the part of her former friends. Josef, who emigrated after the Russian invasion, is back in Prague to fulfill a wish of his beloved late wife. As fate would have it, the two have met before in their former lives, and the before-skirted passionate encounter is now destined to transpire. However, as in the story of Odysseus, which this novel so deliberately parallels, every homecoming brings with it a conflicting set of emotions so powerful that one has to question whether the voyage is really worth the pain. Expertly tackling the philosophical and emotional themes of nostalgia, memory, love, loss, and endurance, Kundera continues to astound readers with his masterful ability to understand and articulate issues so central to the human condition. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i>The French-Czech novelist Milan Kundera was born in the Czech Republic and has lived in France since 1975. He is the author of the internationally acclaimed and bestselling novels The Joke, Life is Elsewhere, The Farewell Waltz, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Immortality, and the short-story collection Laughable Loves -- all originally in Czech. His more recent novels , Slowness, Identity, and Ignorance, as well as his nonfiction works, The Art of the Novel, Testaments Betrayed, The Curtain, and Encounter, were originally written in French.</p><h2>Fashion: The Mirror of History</h2><p>A history of fashion since the legendary fig leaf looks at leading couturiers and traces clothing trends and styles in light of social, cultural, and technological developments</p><p></p><h2>The Story ESV Bible</h2><p><p><em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Story ESV Bible</em>&nbsp;is the first Bible edition to use the popular evangelism content published in&nbsp;<em>The Story</em>&nbsp;by Spread Truth Ministries.

This is a region of stunning landscapes and water views, crisp ocean-reflected light, classic villages, and abundant opportunities for playful living. Architecture of the Cape Cod Summer presents more than ten years of evocative design and well crafted construction that is rooted in this fabled place. In an architectural world increasingly polarized between strict revivalist classicism and ?avant-garde? abstraction, the work of Polhemus Savery DaSilva displays a compelling third way. The book features twenty-five projects that range from modest to elaborate. Each is an individual creation tailored to its specific location and client. Several additional projects are depicted in a chronology of the firm?s major work. The volume contains an eloquent introduction and text by Michael J. Crosbie, as well as forewords by renowned architects Cesar Pelli and Robert Venturi. An essay by John R. DaSilva, Design Partner, describes the firm?s approach and revisits the genesis of the Shingle Style that is so influential in residential architecture today. Drawings by the firm and more than four hundred color photographs by leading architectural photographers illustrate this sixth volume of the New Classicists series.</p><p></p><h2>When Breaks the Dawn</h2><p>Elizabeth Delancy and her husband, Wynn, a mountie, must rely on their faith to see them through hardships, when Wynn is sent to a new posting</p><p><b>Janette Oke</b> pioneered inspirational fiction and is the leading author in the category today. <i>Love Comes Softly</i>, Janette's first novel, has sold over 1 million copies.

Mohammed Hanif's outrageous debut novel, <i>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</i>, tracks at least two (and as many as a half-dozen) assassination vectors to their convergence in the plane crash, incorporating elements as diverse as venom-tipped sabers, poison gas, the curses of a scorned First Lady, and a crow impaired by an overindulgence of ripe mangoes. The book has been aptly compared to <i>Catch-22</i> for its hilarious (though not quite as madcap) skewering of the Pakistani military and intelligence infrastructure, but it also can trace its lineage to Don DeLillo, doing for Pakistan what <i>Libra</i> did for JFK conspiracy theory, and Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>, with its paranoid-but-true take on pathological bureaucracy. Recent events pushing Pakistan into the worst kind of headlines make <i>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</i> a timely and entertaining read, and when a mysterious bearded man called "OBL" makes an appearance at a Fourth of July party for U.S. military brass, we're coolly reminded of the fickleness of opportunistic policy in unpredictable lands. --<i>Jon Foro</i> <br><br> <b>Mohammed Hanif on his experience in the Pakistan Air Force Academy</b> <p></p>Once upon a time, when I was eighteen, I found myself locked up in Pakistan Air Force Academy's cell along with my friend and partner-in-crime, Khalid Saifullah. We had thought we were doing charity work but the Academy officers obviously didn't share our ideals. We had been caught trying to help another classmate pass his chemistry exam, something he had failed to do twice already and this was his last chance to save himself from being expelled. The logistics of our rescue effort involved a wireless set improvised in the Sunday Hobbies Club, a microphone concealed in a crap bandage around the left elbow of our academically challenged friend, and a Sanyo FM radio receiver. We were running our operation from the roof top of a building next to the examination hall. We were caught red-handed whispering reversible chemical equation into the transistor. <p></p> We were in breach of every single standard operating procedure in the Academy rule book, and faced certain expulsion. We had just started our glorious careers and now we faced the prospect of being sent home and having to explain to our parents how, instead of training to become gentlemen-officers, we were running an exam-cheating-mafia from the rooftop of the most well-disciplined training institute in the country. <p></p> For two days, while we waited in that cell to find out about our fate, we planned our future. Khalid, always the world-wise in this outfit, immediately decided that he was going to join the merchant navy and travel the world. I tried hard to think what I would do. I came from a farming family where even the most adventurous members of our clan had only managed to branch out into planting sugarcane instead of potatoes. Education, jobs, careers were absolutely alien concepts. The Academy was supposed to be my escape from a lifetime that revolved around wildly fluctuating potato crop cycles. And here I was, already a prisoner of sorts, facing a journey back to a life I thought I had left behind. <p></p> "Maybe I&#x2019;ll become a teacher," I said vaguely. The farmers in my village used to show some vague respect to teachers in the primary school I attended. "Or a mechanic." I was a member of the car-maintenance club in the hobbies club after all. It was considered an elite club since there was no car to maintain. It was basically a hobbies club for people who hated hobbies. <p></p> "You can&#x2019;t even change a bloody tire," Khalid reminded me. <p></p> We managed to stave off the impending expulsion through a combination of confession and denial: we lied (we were listening to cricket commentary on the transistor radio), we grovelled (we were ashamed, ashamed, ashamed of our unofficer like behaviour) and we pleaded our undying passion for defending the borders of our motherland. They looked at our relatively clean record, our sterling academic achievements and let us off the hook and awarded us a punishment considered just short of expulsion. We were barred from entering the Academy&#x2019;s TV room--and from walking. For forty-one days. During the punishment period, we had to stay in uniform from dawn till dusk and when ever we were required to go from point a to b we had to run. Khalid went on to become a fairly good marathon runner (before, years later, dying in an air crash, while trying to pull a spectacular but impossible manoeuvre in Mirage fighter plane). I discovered Academy's library. I had barely noticed that the college had a very well-stocked library. We knew it was there, we occasionally used it as a quiet corner to hatch conspiracies but I had never noticed that the long rambling hall was lined with cupboards full of books. All the cupboards were locked, but you could see pristine untouchable books behind their glass doors. The librarian, an eagle-nosed old civilian, walked around with a large bunch of jangling keys although his wares were not in any danger of being stolen. I was to find out later that he was quite a professional. The library was immaculately catalogued. You could of course go to him, fill out a form and request a book. But I never actually saw anybody fill out a form. I spent some afternoons staring at the books from behind the glass doors as my classmates watched videos in the TV room (including the fellow who had scraped through his chemistry exam and survived but would die years later in our current president's General Pervez Musharraf&#x2019;s moronic military adventure in Kargil on India-Pakistan border). <p></p> How do you ask for a book when you are eighteen and have been brought up in a household where the only book was the Quran and the only reading material an occasional old newspaper left behind by a visitor from the city? "I want that book," I asked the librarian pointing tentatively towards a cupboard which contained a thick volume of something called <i>The Great Escapes</i>. The librarian, relieved at having found a customer, took out his bunch of keys, removed a key and asked me to go get it myself. I took my time and browsed for a long time before filling out the form and borrowing the book. So grateful was I for getting that book that I brought him a samosa and cup of tea next day. That turned out to be a very good investment as the librarian handed me the bunch of his keys as soon as I entered. I browsed randomly, recklessly, reading first paragraphs and author bios, and made na�ve judgments. <i>The Cross of Iron</i> wasn&#x2019;t a religious thriller but a war novel. <i>Crime and Punishment</i> had very little crime in it. Was Rushdie related to the famous pop singer Ahmed Rushdie? Mario Puzo and Mario Vargas Llosa. The strange covers of Borges. Abdullah Hussain, I had heard of. A whole shelf devoted to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. <i>Chronicle</i>. Was that little book about the wrecked ship really a true story? I didn&#x2019;t know which one was a thriller and which one was literary. <i>As I Lay Dying</i>--sounds like a nice title so let&#x2019;s read it. So does <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>. It is probably not the right way to read. Discovering books was like a discovering a second adolescence. I discovered new sensations in my body. It was even better. It was guilt-free and I could show off. Not that anyone except my librarian friend was impressed. <p></p> Outside the library, the world revolved around parade square, hockey fields and series of punishments and rewards that didn&#x2019;t seem very different from each other. The vocabulary used to run the Academy life comprised of about fifty words, half of which were variations on the word 'balls.' Every order began or ended with balls, it was used as verb, adjective, qualifier or just simply a howl. Balls to you. Balls to mother, my balls, I'll cut your balls.... Every order, every threat, every compliment was a variation on the same testicular theme. Now that I look back at, it is quite obvious that this place was drowning in its own testosterone. <p></p> From outside, life could seem orderly. Uniforms were starched, rifles were oiled and sessions on the parade square hard and long. I yearned for that jangling of the keys in the library corridors. Once I was caught in my Navigation class reading <i>Notes from the Underground</i> hidden under a map that I was supposed to be studying. After our second year in the Academy, there were sudden attempts to turn us into good Muslims. Compulsory prayers. Quran lectures. Islamic Studies classes. In the third year we were caught stealing oranges from a neighbourhood orchard and as a punishment we were sent out to a mosque outside the Academy where Muslim cousins of Jehovah's Witnesses taught us how to knock on random doors and preach Islam. <p></p> "But they are all Muslims," I had protested. <p></p> "So are you," came the reply. "And look at yourself." <p></p> At that time I didn&#x2019;t realise that we were an experiment in Islamisation of the whole society. General Zia was a distant presence. He was our commander-in-chief and the permanent president of Pakistan. He thought he was never going to die. So did we. <p></p> Years later, sitting in the officers' mess of a Karachi air base, we heard about the plane crash that killed him and several other generals. We were sad about the pilots and the crew of the plane. To drown our sorrows we pooled our meagre savings, ordered a bottle of Black Label whiskey, and instead of hiding in our bachelor quarters as we normally did, we opened the bottle in the officers' mess TV room and discussed our future. I left the air force a month later. <p></p> <i>--Mohammed Hanif</i>Mohammed Hanif heads the BBC&#x2019;s Urdu service.

In this elegant book, Robert Harbison explores the captivating hold these remains and broken pieces&#x2014;from architecture, art, and literature&#x2014;have on us. Why are we, he asks, so suspicious of things that are too smooth, too continuous? What makes us feel, when we look upon a fragment, that its very incompletion has a kind of meaning in itself? Is it that our experience on earth is inherently discontinuous, or that we are simply unable to believe in anything whole?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Harbison guides us through ruins and fragments, both ancient and modern, visual and textual, showing us how they are crucial to understanding our current mindset and how we arrived here. First looking at ancient fragments, he examines the ways we have recovered, restored, and exhibited them as artworks. Then he moves on to modernist architecture and the ways that it seeks a fragmentary form, examining modern projects that have been designed into existing ruins, such as the Castelvecchio in Verona, Italy and the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin. From there he explores literature and the works of T. S. Eliot, Montaigne, Coleridge, Joyce, and Sterne, and how they have used fragments as the foundation for creating new work. Likewise he examines the visual arts, from Schwitters&#x2019; collages to Ruskin&#x2019;s drawings, as well as cinematic works from Sergei Eisenstein to Julien Temple, never shying from more deliberate creators of ruin, from Gordon Matta-Clark to countless graffiti artists.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> From ancient to modern times and across every imaginable form of art, Harbison takes a poetic look at how ruins have offered us a way of understanding history and how they have enabled us to create the new.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Robert Harbison</b> is former professor of architecture at London Metropolitan University. He is the author of many books, including <i>Reflections on Baroque</i>, <i>Travels in the History of Architecture</i>, and <i>Ruins and Fragments</i>.<br> &nbsp;<p>&#x201c;<i>Ruins and Fragments </i>is a wonderfully alluring poem of absence: it weaves together such diverse strands as the language of Finnigan&#x2019;s Wake, the montage of Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, the aggressions of analytical Cubism and the reconstruction of the Warsaw Market Square into an enticing panorama of our perplexing times.&#x201d;</p> (Joseph Rykwert, author of The Judicious Eye, The Seduction of Place and The Idea of a Town)<br><br><p>&#x201c;A marvelous story-teller and shorer of fragments, Robert Harbison surveys the destiny of ruins from Oxyrynchus to the films of Ozu, to Phimai and beyond. Yet his underlying concern remains the aftermath of &#x2018;war, cruelty, suffering&#x2019;&#x2014;the perpetual assault of human folly upon human constructions&#x2014;and the history of our often poorly conceived attempts to rebuild. Harbison has composed a spell-binding meditation on the inevitability of fragmentation and dispersal.&#x201d;</p> (Susan Stewart, Avalon Foundation University Professor of the Humanities and Director, Society of Fellows in the Liberal Arts)</p><h2>Healing Touch for Children: Massage, Acupressure and Reflexology Routine for Children Aged 4-12</h2><p>Massage, acupressure and reflexology routines for children aged 4-12.<br><br>Research has shown that short, simple routines of massage practiced on children can help reduce stress and tiredness, increase alertness and concentration, and help combat a wide range of ailments, including breathing problems, coughs and colds, and myriad aches and pains. <br><br>Expert massage practitioner Mary Atkinson gives a thorough overview of this increasingly popular practice.

Thus far, Teeton has kept each aspect of his life separate from one another, but when he returns home and joins an incipient revolt, his once separate worlds begin to fuse together with disastrous results. This novel is a powerful study of the impossibility of disentangling British and Caribbean lives, the nature of misogyny, and the conflict between the calls of art and revolution.</p></p><p><b>George Lamming</b> is the author of <i>The Emigrants</i>, <i>In the Castle of My Skin</i>, <i>Natives of My Person</i>, <i>Of Age and Innocence</i>, <i>The Pleasures of Exile</i>, and <i>Season of Adventure</i>.

In <b>In A Sunburned Country</b>, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world&#x2019;s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> reports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably. Though <i>A Short History</i> clocks in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of <i>Life</i> and <i>Trilobite</i>) and these interviews are charming. But it's when Bryson dives into some of science's best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway Morris vs. Gould--that he finds literary gold. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>&#x201c;Stylish [and] stunningly accurate prose.

In the early days these were float planes that were lowered by crane into the sea and then lifted back aboard upon their return. This was a lengthy affair and when a speedy departure was necessary, time was of the essence. A new system was devised so that a powerful catapult system and a short ramp could, with the added speed of the ship, get an aircraft airborne in a fraction of the time previously required. Thus was born a highly specialized type of aircraft.<br><br>This book includes all the major designs that went to war in the First and Second World Wars and includes aircraft used by all the combatants.

In America, the Thanksgiving holiday is almost inconceivable without Macy's annual parade. But how did holiday traditions like this begin? Who are the behind-the-scenes magicians that conjure up this unique blend of imagination, showmanship, and salesmanship? <p><i>Holidays on Display</i> is a comprehensive overview of the art and industry of the holiday display. Author William L. Bird, Jr., traces its evolution as holiday decorations moved from shop windows to building exteriors and out into the street in the form of parade floats. In this fascinating and colorful history we are introduced to turn-of-the-century "trimmers" hiredby merchants to maintain product displays, and we marvel as advances in lighting, animation, and miniaturization lead to the incredible feats of creative self-expression practiced by today's window artists. Packed with rarely seen photographs and ephemera, <i>Holidays on Display</i> makes it easy to see why we have such lasting emotional attachments to animated Christmas windows, passing parades, and the ambient glow of holiday lights.</p></p><p>William L.

Which may be one reason the National Museum of American History created `Holidays on Display,' an exhibition that opened Friday. Composed mainly of photographs and illustrations, the show looks at the art and business behind such seasonal spectacles as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Tournament of Roses Parade, the Miss America Pageant boardwalk parade, even the Washington Monument Centennial Celebration in 1948." --The Washington Post<br><br>"The holidays are a time of excess, from decorations and food to parades and retail displays. We splurge on gifts, we make rich feasts for friends and family; we gather close to the people we love, seeking comfort in midwinter. The Smithsonian invited Santa &amp; Mrs. Clause and Twinkle the Elf to the National Museum of American History to open a new small exhibit on the Holidays. Focused on Parades of all seasons, from Tournament of Roses through to Macy's Thanksgiving, and the retail window displays of department stores (something of a relic to those of us under 40) all across the US, the new exhibit has photos and artifacts from holiday celebrations across the country." --We Love DC<br><br>"Santa Claus is making an early appearance to open a new exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History on the art and business of commercial holiday displays. <p>The exhibit is a first for the museum and opens Friday. It covers the elaborate department store windows and retail displays dating back to the 1920s, as well as the creation of floats for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. </p><p>During its heyday in the 1950s, the Woodward and Lothrop department store in D.C. was known to have featured live penguins in a window display. </p><p>The exhibit follows the research of curator William Bird who examined the history of holiday displays from the early 20th century in a companion book." --MyFOXDC<br><br>"Holidays on Display provides a vivid set of color photos capturing department store festive window displays and reviews the overall art of the holiday display. The author traces this display's changes from basic holiday decorations to works of art, floats, and more, offering a fine history of rare photos and ephemera in the process.

In this ethnography, Marcia Ochoa considers how femininities are produced, performed, and consumed in the mass-media spectacles of international beauty pageants, on the runways of the Miss Venezuela contest, on the well-traveled Caracas avenue where transgender women (<i>transformistas</i>) project themselves into the urban imaginary, and on the bodies of both <i>transformistas</i> and beauty pageant contestants (<i>misses</i>). Placing<i> transformistas</i> and <i>misses </i>in the same analytic frame enables Ochoa to delve deeply into complex questions of media and spectacle, gender and sexuality, race and class, and self-fashioning and identity in Venezuela.<p></p><p>Beauty pageants play an outsized role in Venezuela. The country has won more international beauty contests than any other. The femininity performed by Venezuelan women in high-profile, widely viewed pageants defines a kind of national femininity. Ochoa argues that as<i> transformistas</i> and <i>misses</i> work to achieve the bodies, clothing and makeup styles, and postures and gestures of this national femininity, they come to embody Venezuelan modernity.</p></p><p><p>Marcia Ochoa is Associate Professor of Feminist Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>"A gifted ethnographer with an eye for detail, Marcia Ochoa weaves rich narratives of contemporary Venezuela and its complex cultural geography of gendered, sexualized, racialized, and classed bodies and selves caught in the pursuit of alluring beauty and accomplished femininity. <i>Queen for a Day</i> is a queer diasporic ethnography that complicates practices of cultural consumption and production within the shifting terrains of normality and 'abnormality,' the nation and the global, and home and away." (Martin F. Manalansan IV, author of <i>Global Divas: Filipino Gay Men in the Diaspora</i>)<br><br>"Marcia Ochoa's engaging ethnographic meditation on femininity in Venezuela focuses on gays, women, and transgendered people who perform glamour in beauty pageants and as sex workers on the street called Avenida Libertador. This work reveals the social forces as well as the plastic surgery and injections that produce desired female bodies. Ochoa's world of high frivolity that many do not take seriously reveals much about Venezuela that cannot be learned from the earnest realm of male politics."

Having accomplished a near miracle with <em>Life After Life</em>, in which she used a literary-do-over trope to tell the story of a British woman living between and after the two World Wars, Kate Atkinson now dares to write a companion novel that focuses on <em>Life</em>&#x2019;s heroine Ursula Todd&#x2019;s brother Teddy. Never mind that careful readers of the first book came away with the impression that Teddy most often turned up dead, in this one he&#x2019;s an old man trying to come to grips with his post-War life and with a modern world and family. Switching back and forth in time (Atkinson can&#x2019;t seem to help it...) between memories of his childhood and his present, Teddy emerges as a befuddled and somewhat stodgy old-man version of himself, a startlingly oblivious husband to stalwart Nancy and a wittily rueful father to a grown up daughter (&#x201c;Viola was the solitary arrow they had shot blindly into the future, not knowing where she would land,&#x201d; Teddy thinks. &#x201c;They should have aimed better.&#x201d;) Teddy never quite got over the War and he suspects that the &#x201c;fact&#x201d; of his being alive is as arbitrary as Ursula&#x2019;s demise(s). (&#x201c;He had been reconciled to death during the war and then suddenly the war was over and there was a next day and a next day. Part of him never adjusted to having a future.&#x201d;) Scenes from his past bring back Ursula and other characters from the earlier book so that readers who&#x2019;ve come this far with Atkinson will feel a tiny thrill of recognition; but new readers needn&#x2019;t fear they&#x2019;re missing the joke. There&#x2019;s way less gimmick here than in the earlier book, and sometimes I almost longed for more; it was so provocative. But whether read alone or as a follow up, <em>A God in Ruins</em> is a novel to savor, another beautiful, tender and sly Atkinsonian glimpse into the world of a so-called ordinary mid-century British family. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>KATE ATKINSON won the Whitbread (now Costa) Book of the Year prize with her first novel, <i>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</i>.

From the moment Sammy wakes slumped in a park corner, stiff and sore after a two-day drunk and wearing another man's shoes, James Kelman's Booker Prize-winning novel <i>How Late it Was, How Late</i> loosens a torrent of furious stream-of-consciousness prose that never lets up. Beaten savagely by Glasgow police, the shoplifting ex-con Sammy is hauled off to jail, where he wakes to a world gone black. For the rest of the novel he stumbles around the rainy streets of Glasgow, brandishing a sawed-off mop handle and trying in vain to make sense of the nightmare his life has become. Sammy's girlfriend disappears; the police question him for a crime they won't name; the doctor refuses to admit that he's blind; and his attempts to get disability compensation tangle in Kafkaesque red tape. Gritty, profane, darkly comic, and steeped in both American country music and working class Scottish vernacular, Sammy's is a voice the reader won't soon forget. <i>--Mary Park</i>"A work of marvelous vibrance and richness of character...It convinces, it charms, it entertains, it informs and it has life."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Witty, irreverent and thoroughly engrossing...Kelman is a major talent, and this is a bold, highly accomplished novel."--<i>San Francisco Sunday Examiner and Chronicle</i></p></p><h2>Sweep: The Story of a Girl and Her Monster</h2><p><b>A brand-new novel by one of today's most powerful storytellers, <i>Sweep</i> is a heart-rending adventure about the everlasting gifts of friendship and hope.</b><br><br>For nearly a century, Victorian London relied on "climbing boys"--orphans owned by chimney sweeps--to clean flues and protect homes from fire.

Newt was newest to Crudd&#x2019;s crew. He was barely six years old; he didn&#x2019;t know all the rules. The first rule was you never asked another climber about his life Before. <br> There were five climbing boys in the coal bin: Newt, Whittles, Shilling-Tom, Roger, and Nan. Nan wasn&#x2019;t a boy, but you&#x2019;d never know that to look at her. She was as grimy as the rest of them. &#x201c;Who told you about the Sweep?&#x201d; Nan said. &#x201c;Was it Roger?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Keep me out of it, Cinderella,&#x201d; Roger muttered. He called Nan &#x201c;Cinderella&#x201d; because he thought it annoyed her. He was right. <br> &#x201c;No one told me,&#x201d; Newt said. &#x201c;I <i>dreamed </i>about him. Last night I slept in your corner. I dreamed him and the girl were both singing to all the people. Only I woke up before I could hear the words.&#x201d; <br> This was a thing that happened: the dreaming. Every so often one of the boys would say that he had dreamed about the Sweep. Nan couldn&#x2019;t explain it. It seemed to happen whenever one of them fell asleep close to her. All she knew was that she didn&#x2019;t like it. The Sweep was <i>hers</i>.<br> &#x201c;It was about you, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Newt whispered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the girl from my dream.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Nan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the girl who wants to go to sleep.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d spent fourteen hours climbing chimneys and knew there were more waiting for her tomorrow.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re splashing in the wrong puddle, Newt,&#x201d; said a raspy voice by the slat window. It was Whittles. He was only eight, but his voice sounded like an old man&#x2019;s on account of breathing too much chimney soot. &#x201c;Me and Shilling-Tom been dreaming about the girl and her Sweep for years. Not once have we gotten Nan to fess up that it&#x2019;s her.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; said Shilling-Tom. He was Whittles&#x2019;s best mate. &#x201c;You might as well try to get a second helping from Trundle&#x2019;s pot.&#x201d; Trundle was the woman who cared for them. If you could call it that. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t fess up because it&#x2019;s nonsense,&#x201d; Nan said. And it was nonsense. How could two people have the same dream?<br> &#x201c;Is the Sweep a real person?&#x201d; Newt asked. &#x201c;He sounds lovely. Much nicer than Master Crudd.&#x201d; He whispered this last bit. Just in case Crudd could hear him upstairs. <br> &#x201c;Sweeps aren&#x2019;t supposed to be lovely,&#x201d; Nan said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re grimy and tough as stone. Just like chimneys.&#x201d; Maybe <i>lovely </i>was a fine thing to call a person in Newt&#x2019;s old life, but he was a climber now. He wouldn&#x2019;t last long if he kept using words like that.<br> She heard the boy move closer. &#x201c;Please, Nan?&#x201d; Her eyes had adjusted to the dim light, and she could see the outline of his head. With his curls shaved of, he really did look like a newt. They had named him well. &#x201c;Just tell me if he&#x2019;s real. I promise I won&#x2019;t tell the others.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t beg. A climber never begs.&#x201d; That was another rule.<br> &#x201c;Maybe I can sleep here next to you?&#x201d; He clasped her arm. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll dream about him all on my own?&#x201d;<br> Nan knew what the boy was saying. He thought that some-how the dreams were coming from <i>her</i>, which was impossible. She pulled away. &#x201c;Find your own corner.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Aw, go easy on the kid.&#x201d; It was Whittles. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only been a week since he . . . you know . . .&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t say the rest. None of them knew what had happened to Newt&#x2019;s family to have him end up here, but it had to have been bad. It was always bad. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not begging,&#x201d; Newt said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a true fact: I can&#x2019;t sleep without a bedtime story. My mummy always says . . .&#x201d; He corrected himself. &#x201c;. . . always <i>said </i>. . .&#x201d; His voice faltered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just I thought hearing a story about the Sweep might help me fall asleep.&#x201d; <br> Nan remembered when she had felt the same way. That was a long time ago. That was Before.</p><h2>The Body on the Beach: A Fethering Mystery</h2><p>Retiree Carole Seddon&#39;s peaceful life in the English seaside town of Fethering is turned upside down when she stumbles upon a corpse on the beach while walking her dog and joins forces with her bohemian neighbor, Jude, to find a killer.</p><p><b>Simon Brett</b>, called by <b>The Baltimore Sun</b> "one of the wittiest mystery writers around", is the author of the Mrs. Pargeter Mystery series, and the creator of the Charles Paris mysteries. <b>Death on the Downs</b> is the second novel in the new Fethering Mystery series, following <b>The Body on the Beach</b>.

Events, alas, take over, and the story reveals the darker sides of an English seaside town. Pungent wit flows razor-sharp out of Howard; each word is uttered with an exactitude that perfectly mirrors the droll social commentary that sets Brett's book apart from the rest of its genre.

Among the iconic projects for which Stone is responsible are The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. But a negative reception among the architectural community often accompanied his popular and commercial successes, a double edge that continues to inform his legacy.

Among her award-winning books are The Snake Scientist and The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans. She made four expeditions to Peru and Brazil to study the pink dolphins of the Amazon. She lives in New Hampshire.<p>Gr 5-9-These unusual creatures of the Sundarbans-a mangrove forest stretching along the Bay of Bengal in India and Bangladesh-really do hunt and eat humans. Montgomery invites readers to journey with her to the region to better understand these elusive animals. "And here you-leave cars behind. You can get to the tigers' forest only by boat." She introduces several knowledgeable residents who describe their experiences. The author also explains many aspects of the rapid loss of the world's tiger population, the little understood behavior of this region's tigers, the lives and beliefs of local people, and the special features of the habitat and its role in supporting a chain of animal life. The largely conjectural knowledge of the tigers is handled carefully, but the lack of immediacy may tax the patience of readers expecting the more dramatic encounter with tigers suggested by the title and cover photo. The mysterious creatures are well concealed by the mangroves, and the few appearing here in handsome photographs are actually in captivity. There are also fine views of other animals, the natural setting, and the people. Montgomery's personal enthusiasm and knowledge extend nicely into the book's informative concluding elements that include fast facts, a glossary of Bengali phrases, a list of related organizations, and comments on the photographs.-Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Dark Nadir (Sholan Alliance)</h2><p><b>The fifth book in Lisanne Norman's Sholan Alliance long-running science fiction series of alien contact and interspecies conflict</b><br><br>The world of Jalna had revealed many secrets to the Sholan-Human teams sent there on a rescue mission.

Reprint.</p><p>A leading African-American scholar of the law, known for decrying the underrepresentation of minorities in the academy, reflects on protest and race in America. Four years ago, Bell (Law/New York Univ.; Faces at the Bottom of the Well, 1992, etc.), then at Harvard, protested the absence of black women from that university's law faculty by taking an unpaid leave of absence. After much dithering, Harvard failed to hire a black woman law professor; once Bell had taken the two years of leave allowed him by its rules, Harvard fired him, refusing to make an exception for his principled stand. Affecting vignettes reveal how Bell's family inspired and sustained his protest. Accounts of faculty politics, in contrast, find Bell pulling his punches. Rather than settle scores, he seeks to knit his personal and professional experiences into a broad exploration of protest and the responses that it provokes. Alongside of his confrontation with the authorities at Harvard, Bell examines protests by such figures as Paul Robeson, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Martin Luther King while weaving into his book--in a manner familiar to readers of his previous work and to those acquainted with the techniques of ``critical race studies''--an allegorical fable in which citizens of a ruling citadel argue over how to treat the downtrodden outside of their walls. Bell illuminates an ugly picture: Protesters become pariahs, true reform may be impossible to achieve, yet struggle is necessary to preserve dignity and self-esteem. If Bell's pessimism seems a bit hyperbolic, his argument lends moral authority to those who exhort us toward social reform--those such as Bell himself, whose perhaps overdue disillusion with Harvard enables him to forcefully pose questions of how and why the institutional imperatives of power and prestige compromise moral vision. Bell's clearly written jeremiad, with its moving portrait of the author as exemplary protester, will inspire new examinations of struggles in our citadels of power--perhaps even new protests there. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The first black professor tenured at Harvard Law School, Bell (Faces at the Bottom of the Well) lost his job in 1992 after protesting-by taking an unpaid leave of absence-the school's failure to hire and tenure a woman of color. Reflecting first on his youth and career as a civil rights laywer, Bell offers a candid tale of infighting at Harvard Law. The school, he argues persuasively, places more emphasis on paper credentials than proven skills, thus limiting faculty diversity of race, sex and class. During his first year of protest, Bell agreed to teach a seminar at Harvard for free; in his second year, he was a visiting teacher at New York University Law School, where he remains. He describes how warring ideological factions defeated the appointment of a black woman candidate at Harvard Law. The officials there refused to waive a rule limiting faculty leaves to two years, and Bell was fired as he began his third year of protest. While a few observations here ring false-do students really not protest poor teaching by white professors?-Bell raises important questions about institutional racism and offers resonant thoughts on the tradition of protest and its importance to self-esteem. 25,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gwen the Beauty and the Beast Fairy (The Fairy Tale Fairies #5)</h2><p>Happily Ever After?<br><br>Once upon a time, Rachel and Kirsty were excited to attend the special Fairy Tale Festival at TipTop Castle.

But of course real tools are a little too hazardous for those tiny fingers. So Caldecott Honor artist Stephen T. Johnson (<i>Alphabet City</i>) came up with a fun and educational solution: a combination toolbox and book! With its seven sturdy cardboard tools, bolts and screws that really turn, and erasable slate, this handy kit will provide hours of entertainment--and may keep those youngsters out of the grownup toolbox. Each two-page spread features a removable working tool and a different shape to work on. Turn the hand drill in the premade holes in a triangle. Pound pretend nails into a star shape. Cut a piece of "wood" into two rectangles--with a satisfying rasping sound! While they're becoming amateur carpenters, children will learn some basic skills in counting, shapes, and colors; on each colorful background, readers see one piece of paper, two pieces of wood, three holes, and so on up to six nails. This handsome red book includes a pencil, ruler, saw, drill, screwdriver, wrench, hammer, and slate for drawing up plans. Smaller children may need some help prying the tools out of their snug compartments, at least until the tools get a little worn in. (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Stephen T.

He works as a publisher, literary critic and broadcaster."You know how it ends: everybody dies." Thus begins Beigbeder's gripping apocalyptic novel, which takes place on September 11, 2001 - the date on which New York realtor Carthew Yorston has taken his seven- and nine-year-old sons for a long-promised breakfast at the eponymous eatery atop the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Alternating with Smith's narration is the voice of Beigbeder himself - or a thinly disguised version of the French author - musing about the tragedy one year later over his own breakfast in Le Ciel de Paris, on the 56th floor of the Tour Montparnasse, the tallest building in Paris. Each chapter of the novel represents one minute on that fateful morning, from 8:30 to 10:29; nearly all are less than three pages, and several prove startling in their brevity ("In the Windows, the few remaining survivors intone Irving Berlin's 'God Bless America' (1939)"). Both men riff on everything from trivia to politics and make often poignant philosophical observations. Abundant doses of gallows humor at once add levity and underscore the drama. Yorston's overheard snatches of fatuous cell-phone conversations, for example, would be funny in another context, while the enforced exit of a cigar-smoking guest at Windows on the World "thereby proves that a cigar can save your life." Though some readers may be put off by this novel's subject matter, Beigbeder invests his narrators with such profound humanity that the book is far more than a litany of catastrophe: it is, on all levels, a stunning read. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How do words make the past appear? In what way does the historian summon bygone events? What is this kind of remembering, and for whom do we recall the dead, or the past? In this highly original meditation on the past, renowned art historian Alexander Nemerov delves into what it means to recall a significant event&#x2014;Pearl Harbor&#x2014;and how descriptions of images can summon it back to life. Beginning with the photo album of a former Japanese kamikaze pilot, which is reproduced in this volume, Nemerov transports the reader into a different world through his engagement with the photographs and the construction of a narrative around them. Through its lyrical prose, Summoning Pearl Harbor expands what we traditionally associate with ekphrastic writing. The kind of writing that can enliven a work of art is also the kind of writing that makes the past appear in vivid color and deep feeling. In the end, this timely piece of writing opens onto fundamental questions about how we communicate with each other, and how the past continues to live in our collective consciousness, not merely as facts but as stories that shape us. Here, Nemerov&#x2019;s constant awareness of the power of language to make an experience&#x2014;seen or remembered&#x2014;become real reminds us that great ekphrastic writing is at the heart of every effective description.</p><p>Alexander Nemerov is department chair and the Carl and Marilynn Thoma Provostial Professor in the Arts and Humanities at Stanford University. Prior to joining Stanford, he was a professor of art history and American studies at Yale University. He has published several books and articles pertaining to the culture of American art dating from the eighteenth century to the 1970s. His writing often analyzes fiction and poetry alongside works of visual art.</p><h2>Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome</h2><p>Only 2 per cent of our DNA contains the codes to produce proteins, so for many years scientists assumed that the rest of the genome was simply &#39;junk&#39;.

The executive's hands remained folded calmly on the desk's highly polished surface, the reflection below his fingers making him look like some double-handed android built to play a newly invented hellrock instrument. "You want an alien," Keene repeated. Damon squelched the impulse to remind Keene that this wasn't a psychiatric bull session where the doctor repeated everything the patient said to make sure he had understood it clearly. "Let's see." Keene continued. "You're not into weapons, so that's out. You're not into medicine or drugs, either. That puts those out of the picture. So exactly what do you need an alien <i>for</i>, Damon?"<br><br>Damon spread his hands, unconsciously willing Keene to understand, to show the slightest trace of empathy. "For the <i>sound</i>." The last word carried on the filtered air of the office like a drawn-out whisper, a sibilant floating in the air that teased both of them. Finally, a reluctant crack in Keene's disposition as the older man unwillingly bonded with Damon's dreams for an instant, hearing as the eccentric artist did the alien singing from its steel throat and screaming with a tongue of acidic flame.<br><br>Damon's words faded away as he and Keene stared at each other.<br><br>Bitter memories flash-danced in Damon's head as he waited for Keene's decree, and he remembered the first time an alien's screams had ever found its way into his ears. It had been on a vidscreen in a store window, a NewsVid item from Channel 86 about an infestation in the Long Island Incarceration Colony, sensationalist crap designed solely to grab the passersby and glue them to a vidscreen. And it had worked on Damon, though not for the reasons the media planners might have anticipated. The footage had shown a clot of aliens bunched in a subbasement of the LIIC's main prison, on the defensive against an army troop wearing suits constructed of the same material labs used to store acid and bearing flamethrowers loaded with long-burning jellied napalm. To Damon the creatures' screams had translated to one thing, unadulterated or diluted: <i>hate.</i><br><br>And Damon <i>hated&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>so very, very much...<br><br>How many reviewers had slammed his work as "tiresome," or "obscure," or, worst of all, "boring"? The reviewers detested him, the public ignored him, Synsound humored him. All the while he struggled on, trying desperately to reach a public that seemed to want only hellrock or bloodrock, or--God help them--android singers and performers so mutated that they had four arms, multiple heads, and mouths coming out of their mouths in a twisted parody of aliens. The closest John Q. Public came to exposure to the gentler sounds of the past was, again, in recreated androids; before dwindling into ambiguity, Elvis Presley's duplicate had piqued enough interest to gain a hall named after it, and Caruso's fabricated double sang for the upper class every night at the NewMet Opera House. A steady trickle of credits from the older generation supported Synsound projects like "Buddy Holly Sings Garth Brooks III" and thousands of other re-recordings of centuries-dead artists--androids of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Charlie Parker, Clifford Brown, Richie Valens, Dwayne Allman, John Lennon, Patsy Cline, and others regularly belted out new hits.<br><br>And Synsound, owner of practically every piece of music and musician in the world--including Damon--sat above it all with people at its helm like Jarlath Keene, a man with virtually no imagination, no <i>vision</i>.<i> </i>As far as Damon was concerned, the stages of Presley Hall were the Manhattan home of hell on earth, filled with appalling reengineered mutadroids that were half android, half mutated instrument, surrounded by the dregs of humanity who flocked to listen to the groups. Few people appreciated Damon's careful live recordings of serious music, the darker blends from wonderful classic composers like Beethoven, Paganini, Mozart, Vivaldi, Bach, so much beautiful music recorded on rare twentieth-century instruments--violins, harps, dulcimers--all expensive and a struggle to come by. Synsound again, indulging him, <i>using </i>him as a pawn to show the world how it sponsored and supported what remained of the "arts" while it survived--<i>prospered--</i>on the ridiculous, discordant trash for which the people of this century constantly clamored. He hated Synsound almost as much as he detested the concertgoers who appreciated only torture and terror, responded only to the grotesque, frightening androids cavorting and screaming on the stage. If what they wanted was hate, and pain, and the repulsive, Damon decided, <i>he would give them exactly that.</i><br><br>The press conference he'd called was only a stage for him to announce to the country and every place the NewsVid would carry the story how much he <i>hated</i>--John Q. Public, Synsound, <i>everything</i>.<i> </i>His tirade against Synsound and its customers had gone on for as long as he dared before he feared the media would turn away in boredom. <i>"For you all, for Synsound," </i>he'd railed into their microphones, "<i>I will write the ultimate composition...a Symphony of Hate!"&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Afterwards his employer smiled its corporate face and nodded, pleased at the attention its pet artiste had generated and shrugging off Damon's anger with a humorous attitude. He was an artist after all; they were supposed to be temperamental, angry, excitable. It was those very feelings that made them <i>creative</i>.<br><br>Damon's work on his masterpiece had carried him everywhere. No place was too dark or dangerous: he visited madhouses, prison wards, even execution chambers where he watched killers leave this world shrieking in rage. A favorite haunt was the downtown government detox center where the screams of jelly junkies bruised the eardrums and forced the workers to wear hearing protection.<br><br>But it was the news item that made Damon search the sound library for VidDiscs from the Homeworld War of ten years ago. The poor quality and low fidelity of the military recording devices didn't matter; the screams of the aliens as they fought and were destroyed blasted through Damon's senses like electricity, burning his mind, stealing his breath. No one and nothing else in the world sounded like an alien, <i>nothing. </i>And nowhere else did the creatures' shrieks of malevolence belong more than in Damon Eddington's Symphony of Hate.</p><h2>Merchant Kings: When Companies Ruled The World, 1600-1900</h2><p>An engaging blend of biography and economic/colonial history, Merchant Kings tells the story of the trading companies that monopolised vast territories all over the world during the first great period of globalisation. The leaders of these trading companies exercised dictatorial power over millions of people, and devoted their time and resources to the accumulation of wealth through hunting, trapping, trade and exploration. It was a harsh existence on the frontiers of the civilised world, and these kings of commerce were larger-than-life characters; adventurers as well as merchants. They included men like Peter Stuyvesant, the one-legged governor of the Dutch West India Company; Cecil Rhodes, founder of the De Beers company (and after whom Rhodesia was named); and George Simpson, the infamous &#39;Little Emperor&#39; of the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, who was chauffeured around his vast fur domain in a giant canoe, exhorting his oarsmen to paddle harder in order to set canoeing speed records. Merchant Kings examines their rise and fall in the centuries before colonialism and empire, analysing the political, social and cultural legacies of this fascinating, cut-throat age.</p><p>Stephen R.

He lives in Canmore, Alberta.MERCHANT KINGS (Chapter one)First among Equals <p>Jan Pieterszoon Coen and the Dutch East India Company</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p> <p>The thirteen heavily armed ships sailed towards the East Indies&#x2019; remote Banda Islands in the spring of 1609, after nearly a year&#x2019;s voyage from Amsterdam. The heady, sweet scent of flowering nutmeg trees filled the humid air. The commander of the squadron, one of the largest corporate fleets yet to depart the Netherlands for &#x201c;the spiceries,&#x201d; was Admiral Pieter Verhoeven (Peter Verhoef), a veteran not of trade and exploration but of combat at sea. He was now employed by the Dutch East India Company, the VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie), with the objective of securing for his employers the exotic cloves and nutmeg of the Moluccas, as the &#x201c;Spice Islands&#x201d; of Indonesia were then known. The admiral commanded more than a thousand fighting men, including a contingent of Japanese mercenaries, and his orders from the &#x201c;Heeren XVII&#x201d; (the Lords Seventeen), his powerful corporate directors in the Netherlands, were direct and clear: &#x201c;We draw your special attention to the islands in which grow the cloves and nutmeg, and we instruct you to strive after winning them for the company either by treaty or by force.&#x201d; Force was something Verhoef understood well, having earned distinction at the Battle of Gibraltar two years earlier, when Dutch ships virtually wiped out a mighty fleet of Holland&#x2019;s bitter enemy, Imperial Spain.</p> <p>As Verhoef and his fleet neared the principal harbour of Great Banda, the admiral was astonished and annoyed to spy an English ship in the sheltered port. For several years now, the Dutch East India Company had been engaged in a simmering conflict with the traders and merchants of the English East India Company. The two companies, vying for control of the lucrative spice trade in Indonesia, each sought to oust the Portuguese and dominate the trade. Captain William Keeling and his ship, Hector, had been cruising the Banda Islands, the world&#x2019;s sole source of nutmeg and mace, trying to secure a cargo of spices for the past month. He had struck up a cordial relationship with Dutch traders stationed on the remote and tiny islands, enjoying dinners ashore and tours of the plantations. All the friendliness dissipated, however, with the arrival of Verhoef&#x2019;s fleet. One of Verhoef&#x2019;s first actions to frustrate Keeling&#x2019;s business was to pay the Bandanese headmen, the orang kaya, to stop trading with the English. Keeling complained that Verhoef treated him and his men &#x201c;most unkindlye, searching his boate disgracefullye and not suffering him to have any further trade, not to gather in his debts, but with a peremptory command, to be gone.&#x201d; More ominously, an English sailor employed in the Dutch fleet deserted and informed his countrymen that Verhoef was planning a secret attack on them within weeks.</p> <p>Keeling pondered his predicament. &#x201c;Sixty-two men against a thousand or more could not perform much,&#x201d; he wrote despondently. Weighing anchor, he took the Hector off to one of the more distant islands, Ai, and began to purchase and load his ship with nutmeg far from the interference of the Dutch. The largest island of the tiny archipelago was called Lonthor, or Great Banda, where several thousand Bandanese tended the largest and most valuable nutmeg plantations. The islands of Neira and Gunung Api were clustered within gunshot of Great Banda. Ai was a little distance to the west, and the smallest of the islands, Run, was farther west. On Great Banda, Verhoef wasted no time in menacing and overawing the islanders, and in enforcing a Dutch company monopoly that excluded all English, Portuguese, Malay and Chinese traders from acquiring a cargo of nutmeg.</p> <p>On April 19, Verhoef ordered 250 heavily armed company troops to disembark from the ships and form up on the beach. He then summoned the orang kaya to hear his speech and petition. When they had gathered, under the shade of a great tree, he distributed gifts and ceremoniously unfurled a parchment. He proceeded to read his pronouncement, first in Portuguese and then in Malay. The islanders had broken their promise, Verhoef intoned, &#x201c;to have trade only with them, who had now traded there six years.&#x201d; Verhoef pointed across the narrow waterway that separated Lonthor from Neira, and informed them that &#x201c;to defend themselves and the whole country from the Portugals,&#x201d; his men would soon begin building a fort and permanent factory on Neira. The orang kaya were as dismayed as Verhoef was determined.</p> <p>The trouble stemmed from an incident that had occurred several years earlier. On May 23, 1602, Dutch captain Wolfert Harmenszoon persuaded some of Neira&#x2019;s chiefs to sign a contract, in Dutch&#x2014;a language they couldn&#x2019;t read&#x2014;granting the Dutch East India Company a monopoly in the nutmeg trade. Some, but not all, of the orang kaya had signed the agreement, fearing to offend the merchants and invite violent reprisals if they refused. But since there was no real benefit in reserving all their spice for the Dutch, they had not abided by the agreement&#x2014;if, indeed, they had ever considered doing so. Now it appeared that the Dutch were taking this document seriously and intending to apply it to all of the nutmeg trade on all the Banda Islands, not just to the region controlled by the signatories.</p> <p>The Bandanese lived in a series of interrelated coastal villages on the islands but, unlike others in the Moluccas, had no overall king or chief. Verhoef did not understand the islands&#x2019; loose governing structure, nor did he know with whom to deal; he simply wanted to secure a veneer of legality for his conquest. The several hundred orang kaya of Great Banda were stunned and perplexed by Verhoef&#x2019;s demands, and their response was evasive and guarded&#x2014;Neira was a separate island with its own orangkaya. They delayed, requesting more time to deliberate the issue: the fact that they had little control over what Verhoef did across the waterway. But the prospect of a permanent stone fort within gunshot distance of their own harbour boded ill.</p> <p>The Bandanese were reminded of a prophecy made a few years earlier by a Muslim holy man that foretold of white strangers from afar who would one day conquer their islands. English traders had mirthfully associated this prophecy with the Dutch. The islanders, however, did not want to be locked into dealing with the Dutch. They much preferred Chinese, Arab and Javanese traders, who were frequently in port, bringing goods the Bandanese valued, such as batiks, calicoes, rice, sago palm, porcelain and medicines. They shared cultures with these peoples, and sometimes religion. The Dutch traders, on the other hand, did not impress with their often useless trade goods, such as woollen and velvet cloth, their strange religion, their irregular visits, ignorance of local customs and inflexible prices. Particularly annoying was Verhoef&#x2019;s demand that the islanders stop selling nutmeg and mace to anyone but the Dutch traders. Further unsettling the Bandanese was the eruption of a volcano on nearby Gunung Api. Ominously, the volcano belched a cloud of cinders and ashes onto Neira just as Verhoef&#x2019;s fleet arrived.</p> <p>As the days and weeks passed in stalled negotiations, Verhoef became agitated and uneasy. He had other business to attend to, particularly his similar mission of securing the Dutch East India Company monopoly over cloves at the islands of Tidore and Ternate, farther north. On April 25, 1609, he ordered about 750 of his soldiers ashore on Neira and set them to work clearing the foundations of an abandoned Portuguese fort. The people of the nearby villages fled to the hills or other islands, and Dutch troops and workers soon occupied their dwellings. Lacking the military power to dislodge the Dutch, and with the walls of the fort creeping ominously higher, the islanders on May 22 sought a meeting with Verhoef to discuss the details of the monopoly he demanded. They selected a remote site on the east of the island for the meeting, and Verhoef set off with a coterie of compatriots, including his most trusted captains, senior merchants and a contingent of heavily armed soldiers. He also dragged along, according to a biased English account, a string of English captives chained together to demonstrate his dominance over that upstart nation.</p> <p>The clearing, however, was deserted. No one was waiting for Verhoef at the appointed meeting place, underneath a giant tree on the beach. Curious rather than afraid, he ordered his interpreter, Adriaan Ilsevier, to scout the surrounding woods, where Ilsevier stumbled upon a group of orang kaya suspiciously concealed in the brush. They informed him that they had become frightened at the sight of so many armed Dutchmen. Would Verhoef please leave his soldiers, arms and guns under the tree, bringing only his senior negotiators to them so that they could talk safely, without the soldiers shadowing the talks?</p> <p>Secure in his assumed superiority, Verhoef consented. He and dozens of his staff marched unarmed into the brush, &#x201c;and being entered among them he found the woods replenished with armed blackamoores, Bandanese, and orang kaya who instantly encircled them and without much conference between them&#x2026;, were by them treacherously and villainously massacred.&#x201d; They screamed out &#x201c;To arms!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Admiral, we are betrayed!&#x201d; but to no avail. Unarmed, they were quickly killed and none escaped. It happened so fast and unexpectedly that the armed guards who rushed the short distance to defend their commander and comrades arrived to find them all slaughtered. Verhoef had been decapitated, and his head was placed on a spiked stick. Over the next few weeks, there was a general uprising of the Bandanese against the Dutch, who scarcely left their ships or the fort. Their work on the half-completed castle, Fort Nassau, continued at an accelerated pace.</p> <p>The new leader of the Dutch company&#x2019;s forces, Simon Hoen, began to &#x201c;execute and practise all revenge possible&#x201d; by attacking islanders, burning villages, burning and destroying boats and plundering anything of value. After some of his troops suffered a defeat by Bandanese forces on July 26, Hoen retreated and ordered a naval blockade of the islands to stop the food imports vital to the survival of the people and to bring commerce to a halt. Soon many of the orang kaya were willing to accede to the company&#x2019;s demands, and they sat down to negotiate with the Dutch invaders. On August 13 they grudgingly agreed to the Dutch monopoly over the nutmeg trade; all incoming ships now had to present themselves at Fort Nassau for inspection and to obtain a pass. And, furthermore, no one could settle on the islands without the permission of the company commander. The entire island of Neira was to become a dominion of the Dutch East India Company, &#x201c;to be kept by us forever&#x201d;&#x2014;the first territorial acquisition by the company.</p> <p>Hoen then sailed north, with the bulk of his fleet, to do business with Ternate and Tidore. But even after this first conquest the Bandanese showed no compunction about working around the Dutch monopoly, secretly shipping their nutmeg to English merchants who had established factories on the outlying islands of Ai and Run. Securing a trade monopoly was simple in theory but difficult to enforce, even on the remote and tiny Banda Islands.</p> <p>In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the Netherlands was arguably the wealthiest and most scientifically advanced of the European nations. This period, known as the Dutch Golden Age, brought a flourishing of the arts and sciences that reflected the period&#x2019;s unbounded optimism and affluence. Prosperous burghers and merchants became patrons of the arts, including sculpture, poetry and drama, and of public debates. They commissioned architects to design beautiful houses. Paintings and sculptures adorned the interior walls of these impressive homes. Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Jacob van Ruisdael and many others revolutionized painting, infusing new life into landscapes, portraiture and still life, as well as portraying contemporary life and society in the flourishing cities that were the most cosmopolitan in Europe. In science, the list of internationally prominent luminaries included the philosopher Ren� Descartes; acclaimed jurist and theorist of international law Hugo Grotius; mathematician, astronomer and inventor of the pendulum clock Christiaan Huygens; and Anton van Leeuwenhoek, inventor of the microscope and founder of the study of microbiology. Book publishing flourished in the climate of tolerance and intellectual curiosity; ideas concerning religion, philosophy and science that were considered too controversial in other nations found their way into print in the Netherlands, and the books were secretly shipped abroad.</p> <p>The Dutch Republic, newly freed from Spanish domination and relishing its freedom, was admirably situated to dominate European trade by providing an artery into the interior. Thousands of ships crowded its many harbours. The great city of Amsterdam was the centre of the international trade in the exotic luxuries of the Americas, India and the &#x201c;Spice Islands.&#x201d; The Amsterdam stock exchange, founded in 1602, was the world&#x2019;s first, created by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for dealing in its own stocks and bonds. The VOC was the first-ever trading company with a permanent share capital. This joint stock company attracted huge wealth in initial capitalization from over 1,800 investors, most of whom were merchants and other wealthy middle-class citizens, and the speculation on the fluctuating value of these shares relied on the success or failure of the company&#x2019;s ships in bringing spices back to Europe from the Far East.</p> <p>The first great global corporation, the VOC, was by the late seventeenth century the most powerful and richest company in the world. Its private fleet boasted nearly 150 merchant ships and 40 giant warships. At the height of its power, it employed nearly 50,000 people worldwide&#x2014;seamen, artisans, stevedores, labourers, clerks and builders. The company was involved in a multitude of commercial activities, such as construction, sugar refining, cloth manufacturing, tobacco curing, weaving, glass making, distilling, brewing and other industries related to its global business enterprises. The payroll also included a 10,000-man private army.</p> <p>The VOC, one of the foundations of Dutch prosperity and with its mighty fleet a key force propelling the young republic to look to the world for commerce, held a virtual monopoly over the global spice supply. It achieved this in a bloody struggle at the dawn of the Age of Heroic Commerce. Ironically, the company&#x2019;s wealth was founded on a system and on values imposed in Indonesia that ran counter to the liberal and tolerant culture of many of its shareholders. Furthermore, its rise to global supremacy as a state monopoly, and its contribution to the artistic and cultural flourishing of the Dutch Republic, was founded on the ruthless strategy of a man whose character was entirely at odds with the character of his nation.</p> <p>Sailing as part of Peter Verhoef&#x2019;s expedition, and witness to what he termed the &#x201c;Vile Bandanese Treachery of 1609,&#x201d; was a junior trader named Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Bandanese uprising and resistance to the VOC, he believed, had been sponsored by perfidious English agents and furthered by the untrustworthy nature of the Bandanese. Coen was destined for historical greatness and, some would argue, infamy. More than a decade later, as the governor general of the VOC&#x2019;s enterprise in the East Indies, Coen would see to it that such disrespect for his company did not go unpunished.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p> <p>The spices of the east indies come from a variet...</p></p><h2>Magical Jewels of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance Particularly in England</h2><p>1922.

Based on speaking engagements surrounding his critical passion and conviction that the church in this moment must set itself in tension with the rest of the world, these essays call the church to courageously defy political polarization, consumerism, and militarism.</p></p><p><b>Walter Brueggemann</b> is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor Emeritus of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia. He is the world's leading interpreter of the Old Testament, and is the author of numerous books, including <i>Introduction to the Old Testament: The Canon and Christian Imagination</i> and <i>Reverberations of Faith: A Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes</i>.Renowned Old Testament scholar Brueggemann offers some profound insights in this collection of essays, roughly tied together by themes of social justice in the Bible and in the contemporary church. The best moments are his specific exegetical observations about the politics, economics, religious practices and community customs of various societies in the Hebrew Bible. Brueggemann produces a persuasive report card on the deficiencies of King Solomon as opposed to King Josiah, measuring their effectiveness by the yardstick of social justice. He examines three magnificent biblical poems of worship and also explores the fourth commandment as a radical "alternative to the quota system of the empire." Despite these flashes of brilliance, the book does not cohere well as a collection. The eleven essays, which Brueggemann delivered orally in various venues throughout 2005, are only loosely connected to one another, though most of the individual pieces are well researched and thought provoking. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Veterinary anthropologist Lawrence's essay explores the horse's rich heritage as a symbol of status, conquest, elemental force and the unmechanized past. Lang, an art professor at Pennsylvania State University, and Marks, a photography dealer and consultant, document the horse's ancient and modern significance in 155 mostly duotone images of rodeos, polo matches and steeplechase races mixed with views of the Parthenon frieze, European statuary and a petroleum company's Pegasus logo. An otherworldly, bleak quality emerges in Cas Oorthuy's photo of a taxidermist's horse still standing amid collapsing buildings and in Richard Misrach's photo of two desiccated carcasses intertwined in the dust, while whimsy prevails in Betty Hahn's cyanotype of the Lone Ranger and Tonto on their mounts. Handsome works by Robert Capa, Hein Gorny, Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand round out this powerful volume. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On the Way to Supermanhood</h2><p>What if man is a &#34;transitional being,&#34; as Sri Aurobindo said long ago, only preparing the way for what is to come next? And perhaps we don&#39;t need any computers or mental acrobatics to prepare the next man. Perhaps we don&#39;t need any spiritual exercies or religions either. Perhaps BEING is enough. But being with a fire of truth in the heart, with a cry of need calling out to the truth of the earth, a cry of suffocation amid the senseless chaos of the present earth - a call for what we ARE behind the game of looks and the mental machinery which shackles us so cleverly.

Famously enjoying international success with The KLF and inviting national controversy for burning a million pounds (quid) with the K Foundation, these days Drummond spends much of his time writing profusely.<br>He avoids and confronts issues, infuriates and inspires those around him, muses and confuses, creates and destroys. He has maintained a penchant for reckless schemes - all this while drinking endless pots of tea.</p><p>Bill Drummond grew up in Scotland. An accomplished artist, manager and musician, he achieved huge critical and commercial success with the KLF; their groundbreaking album The White Room spawned several hit singles. He is the co-author of two other books, THE MANUAL and the novel, BAD WISDOM.'Drummond has the inimitable wisdom of a true maverick' THE TIMES 'It has flashes of twisted brilliance reminiscent of Iain Sinclair or Will Self' GUARDIAN 'Drummond is a cultural magician and this is his logbook' INDEPENDENT 'Invigorating, irritating and endearing, Drummond is a gifted postmodern raconteur with his tongue stuck firmly in his cheek.' IRISH NEWS 'Inspired.' INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY 'With Bill Drummond, it's always best to expect the unexpected. He has made a career out of being gloriously unpredictable. He famously tasted pop success with the KLF, burned a million pounds on a remote Scottish isle and introduced the world to Echo &amp; The Bunnymen and Julian Cope. 45 is as unexpected as the KLF collaborating with Tammy Wynette: a semi-autobiography from a man who has previously been loathe to talk about his work in public. The book takes the form of a collection of short stories and essays focusing on various aspects of Drummond's life. While some chapters are definite page-turners, others move at a more ponderous pace. 45 really comes alive when Drummond discusses hair-brained KLF schemes and K Foundation art stunts. It is within these chapters that he gets closest to confessional, musing on disillusionment, musical myth and the nature of nationalism. Here we get to glimpse into the mind of one of pop's wayward geniuses. Yet it is never more than a mere glimpse. Drummond clearly finds it hard to be truly revelatory. We should, of course, expect this from a man who spent his musical career building up myths, creating alter egos and trying to fool the media and the record-buying public. If anything, 45 illustrates perfectly Drummond's chameleon-like nature. On one hand, he is a shy, retiring family man who enjoys long walks in the country and drinking tea. Yet he is also a tortured genius, a frustrated artist and a man in the throes of a mid-life crisis. When he lets himself go, 45 is a cracking read and one of the most interesting books about music and art in years.'

Whether you're attempting to improve a difficult relationship, struggling to overcome depression, trying to establish a better relationship with your kids, or coping with a stressful work environment, <i>Change Your Life and Everyone In It</i> is filled with inspiring examples of people who have made real and enduring changes in their lives. Focusing on the simple actions that make change possible, Weiner-Davis offers a step-by-step, no nonsense program for discovering and implementing practical solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems.</p><p>Michele Weiner-Davis, MSW, is an internationally renowned relationship expert and author of several books including <i>The Divorce Remedy,</i> the bestselling <i>Divorce Busting, A Woman's Guide to Changing Her Man, Change Your Life and Everyone in It</i>, and <i>In Search of Solutions</i>. She has appeared as a regular guest on <i>Oprah, 48 Hours, The Today Show, CBS This Morning,</i> and taped a seminar on PBS entitled <i>Keeping Love Alive</i>.

She lives in Illinois with her husband of over thirty years.<b><i>Chapter One</i></b><br><br><b>Why Ask Why?</b><br><br>By virtue of the fact that you picked up this book, I know something about you. You're ready for a change in your life. You may want to change something about yourself -- you might want to lose weight, free yourself from depression, or improve your self-esteem. On the other hand, perhaps you feel fine about yourself, it's the people around you who need to shape up -- you might feel your partner is overly critical or inattentive, your kids are driving you nuts, or your coworkers are making your life miserable. Or all of the above.<br><br>I also know that when I say, "You're ready for a change in your life," it doesn't mean that you weren't ready to make this change yesterday, last month, or even last year. Chances are, your thirst for change didn't just happen. You've been thinking and dreaming about it for some time now. You've probably even tried to make things better. But, you're still not where you want to be. Real change, it seems, has been extremely difficult and frustratingly elusive.<br><br>I know because that's exactly what I used to think -- and that's really scary because I'm an "expert," a psychotherapist, a shrink -- the person whose job it is to help people change their lives. But I confess. There was a time when I was stumbling in the dark, when my thinking about truly helping people was just wishful thinking.<br><br>Thankfully, those days are long gone. Through a process of trial and error I figured out what works. I have learned that change isn't nearly as complicated or involved as I once thought.<br><br>I want you to know that there is a new way to find solutions -- immediate solutions -- to chronic problems that doesn't require you to analyze the problem to death. In fact, it doesn't require painful rehashing of the problem at all. Although there's a widespread belief that understanding <i>why</i> you are having a problem will help you to solve the problem, you know in your heart that it simply isn't so. Knowing <i>why</i> you overeat or are depressed doesn't help you control your eating or make you feel better. Understanding how you were raised doesn't help you stop fighting with your spouse or get along better with your kids. Recognizing what's at the root of the friction in the office doesn't make it go away. Perhaps you've secretly suspected this all along but were afraid to acknowledge it because, <i>in theory,</i> analyzing a problem is supposed to help. But you and I both know it doesn't! It only makes you an expert on why you're stuck. By now, you probably have an advanced degree in understanding how the problems in your life came into being, but take it from me, there's no future in it.<br><br>For the past ten years, I have been observing miracles. An eight-year-old girl, described by her teacher as "the most insecure little girl I've ever seen," experiences perpetual urinary problems and a cough so wrenching that she vomits nightly, problems her doctors diagnose as psychosomatic and stress-related. Within weeks, she is symptom-free and is transformed into a well-adjusted, happy, loving, healthy child, leaving her parents, doctors, and teacher amazed. A woman in her mid-twenties, depressed beyond words over the loss of a boyfriend six months before, regains her zest for life within days. A middle-aged salesman at risk of losing his job attacks his work with an enthusiasm he hasn't felt for years and doubles his accounts within weeks. On the brink of divorce, a couple with years of emotional distance between them put a halt to the legal process and successfully regenerate their love.<br><br>If you're thinking that all this sounds too good to be true, I couldn't agree more. After ten years of witnessing countless transformations such as these, I still find them unbelievable. I am in awe of how quickly people find solutions to complex problems or make momentous decisions that radically improve their lives. After all, conventional wisdom suggests that change of any kind is painful and slow. The miracles I see simply defy common sense. They also defy everything I had ever been taught about how people change.<br><br>Seventeen years ago, I hung out my shingle as a professional therapist. My training had been fairly traditional. I had learned to be an empathetic listener, to watch closely for telling body language, to explore people's childhoods to unravel the causes of current problems, to encourage the expression of intense feelings of anger or hurt. I had been taught that people really can't escape the stranglehold of the past until they relive sometimes excruciating memories and glean the appropriate insights or "truths" about their lives. I conscientiously and religiously put these principles into practice but soon discovered a shocking fact. They simply didn't work.<br><br>For example, a couple I was seeing complained of frequent arguments over the handling of money. Each time one of them wished to make a purchase, the other balked and an argument ensued: "You tell me that I shouldn't spend money on new work clothes, but you go to every sporting event imaginable," and so on. Soon, the arguing about money spilled over into other areas of their lives. They now fought about housework, child care, and how free time was spent.<br><br>I had been trained to believe that, in order to overcome problems such as these, people must first gain insight into the ways in which their childhood has influenced them. The theory is that problems are symptoms of underlying issues that stem from childhood experiences and cannot be resolved until the root of the problem is identified and "worked through."<br><br>Accordingly, I determined that this couple's arguments were a symptom of underlying issues of power and control in their marriage. We were very thorough in our search for clues about the origins of these problems. They discussed how each of them was raised and examined their own parents' marriages for telltale signs of similar struggles. Painstakingly, we assembled all the pieces of the puzzle, until it was clear to all three of us how their respective upbringings had affected them. Whereupon the couple turned to me and said, "Michele, now we understand <i>why</i> we are having arguments about money, but we still don't have a clue as to what to do differently." Unfortunately, it wasn't the last time I heard that objection.<br><br>It slowly became apparent to me that understanding <i>why</i> someone has a particular problem has absolutely nothing to do with solving it. All the insight in the world didn't help most of my clients improve the quality of their lives. Those who were overweight knew exactly <i>why</i> they were overeating -- to fill an emotional void, to hide, to repel intimacy, and so on -- but they continued to overeat. Quarrelsome spouses recognized how the divergent expectations they brought to marriage were often at the root of their clashes, but this awareness didn't make one bit of difference: the fighting persisted. People plagued with low self-esteem realized how derogatory, and belittling messages given to them as children made them feel insecure and inadequate, but nothing changed: they still felt lousy. Overly permissive parents acknowledged after long soul-searching that their permissiveness was an extreme reaction to their own restrictive upbringings, but this insight failed to assist them in setting limits for their children. In short, the people with whom I worked all had the usual "aha!" revelations -- flashes of tremendous insight -- but when they returned for subsequent sessions their misery persisted, the only difference being that they were now experts on why they were unhappy.<br><br>The fact that the majority of my clients left therapy enlightened but unchanged confused me. According to my training, the process of gaining insight should have been more helpful. Eager to make sense of my experiences, I asked other therapists about their "therapy failures" and learned that I was not alone. My colleagues, however, concluded that clients who didn't solve their problems during therapy had only themselves to blame. "They're just resistant," I was told. "She is not ready to change." "He is only window-shopping -- not really motivated." It was tempting simply to agree, but at heart I was not convinced. My instincts told me that most people seek professional help because they are in pain and really do want to change. I resolved to find a better way.<br><br>My urgency to find an effective problem-solving method was fueled by other unsettling discoveries about what really goes on behind therapists' closed doors. No longer confident that insight into the past would provide the vehicle for change, I fell back on the other techniques I had been taught to help my clients beyond impasses. One such method is based on the notion that people feel better when they "get their pain and anger out." So, whenever I noticed a wince cross a client's face, indicating fertile emotional ground, I'd faithfully urge, "Let it out, it's okay." I placed boxes of tissues within handy arm's length as an unspoken reminder that tears are good. In no time at all, many of my clients were "letting it out," and when they sobbed I felt proud that I was able to help them do such "intense work." The intensity of the sessions convinced me that I was doing "real therapy."<br><br>But I soon became aware that, instead of feeling relief when they spent the majority of a session discussing painful memories or uncomfortable feelings, my clients felt terrible when they walked out the door. I consoled them (and myself) by reminding them that people must feel their pain in order to get beyond it. But the truth of the matter was that, despite their so-called catharsis, most of my clients didn't get to the other side. Session after session they returned, the dour expression on their faces indicating that nothing had changed.<br><br>It became clear to me that, although "getting it out" was cathartic for some people under certain circumstances, the relief it gave them was short-lived. For others, it brought no relief at all. Some of my more honest clients eventually admitted that they looked forward to therapy sessions about as much they looked forward to going to the dentist. I couldn't keep from pondering the irony that a tool that is supposed to help people feel better seemed to leave many people feeling worse.<br><br>My faith in conventional therapy methods was running thin, but at least I thought I could rely on a principle I'd learned in Psychology 101, that relationship problems can be resolved when people become aware of their "inner feelings" and express them to others. Therefore, I routinely chanted my therapist mantra -- "Look at her and tell her how you feel inside" -- assuming that it would magically bring about a solution. But once again I was disappointed. I discovered that by the time most people come for therapy they are already acutely aware of and have expressed their feelings to others, yet their problems still remain. Exploring these feelings in therapy did nothing to resolve the differences between people.<br><br>For example, even when a parent told his child how her irresponsible behavior in school and at home disappointed and hurt him, she continued cutting classes and being fresh at home. Soon after a woman told her husband that she wanted him to spend more quality time with the family, he informed her that he had signed up for a new golf league. A week after a woman confessed to a friend her irritation at the friend's habitual lateness, her friend showed up a half-hour late for lunch. A husband told his wife that he needed more intimacy in their marriage, yet she continued to use every imaginable excuse to avoid his company. Unfortunately, all of these divulgences seemed to fall on deaf ears. No one changed his or her behavior as a result of hearing how it displeased others, even when the feedback was sincere and sensitively stated.<br><br>Gradually, and reluctantly, I concluded that the effectiveness of understanding and expressing feelings about relationship problems is drastically overrated. In fact, I noticed that rehashing each party's discordant feelings ad nauseam tends to exaggerate differences, making them more difficult to reconcile.<br><br>I was at a loss. It seemed that nothing I had been taught about helping people to change worked. That's when I encountered a radically different therapy approach, solution-oriented brief therapy (SBT). At the time, brief therapy was in its infancy. Scattered about were small revolutionary think tanks, pioneers courageous enough to question traditional psychotherapy gospel. Upon discovering these forward thinkers and their unorthodox methods, I sensed immediately that I had "come home."<br><br>As its name implies, SBT works quickly, enabling most people to resolve their problems in three to six sessions. The secret to its brevity is that, instead of taking a long introspective journey into the past, SBT helps people to envision a positive future and to identify fail-safe strategies for getting there. Instead of channeling people's efforts into understanding <i>why</i> they are experiencing problems, SBT helps them figure out how to resolve problems. Instead of identifying the causes of problems, SBT identifies the causes of solutions. It is a technology for change, not introspection, allowing most people to feel better about their lives within days, not months or years.<br><br>This approach is based on a very simple formula: do more of what works and less of what doesn't. No matter what type of problem people are experiencing or how bad the situation seems at the moment, there are times when things go more smoothly. First, SBT reminds people to recognize <i>what they already know about what works</i> so that they can repeat successful solutions. Second, SBT helps people to identify and eliminate the repetitive, unproductive patterns that lead to failure. The most common complaint I used to hear from clients was, "I still don't know have a clue about what <i>to do</i> to change my situation." I don't hear that anymore. Now my clients leave armed with a plan they can implement the moment they walk out the door.<br><br>As I began practicing SBT, several advantages of this focused approach quickly became apparent. Most people felt some relief from their problems immediately. The emphasis on solutions showed people light at the end of the tunnel, which had a powerfully reassuring effect, especially after months or years of brooding about their problems. Often they had become so immersed in their difficulties that they had come to believe that nothing would or could ever change. SBT got them to question that premise. Many told me as they left the initial meeting that for the first time in months they felt hope.<br><br>It became clear that, the more hopeful people became, the more they expected good things to happen, and therefore the more energy they put into making good things happen -- hence, many more good things did in fact happen. More than ever before, I began to appreciate the power of optimism and the toxicity of pessimism about the future. Pessimism saps people's energies and prevents them from taking -- or noticing -- baby steps forward. I realized that the traditional methods I had been using, by not offering some instant relief, actually increased pessimism, making positive outcomes less likely. The sixties saying "If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem" took on new meaning for me. Part of the magic of SBT, I began to see, is that it immediately became part of the solution, instilling hopefulness and helping people to reverse downward spirals swiftly. Here is a message a woman recently left on my answering machine:<br><br>I called you last week and I wrote you a letter and I was desperate. I was going to commit suicide.

Putting General Relativity to the Test</h2><p>This book is an examination of the way in which Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity - the theory of gravitation and of space-time, has held up under today&#39;s exacting scrutiny of planetary probes, radio astronomy, atomic clocks and electronic super-computers. Clifford M. Will, who has devoted two decades to this question, brings to the general reader a full account of the people, ideas and machines that have put Einstein&#39;s theory to the test, covering tests from about 1960 to check the predictions of general relativity accurately and aims to find new predictions to check. He tells the story of relativity from the first faint photographs in 1919 confirming Einstein&#39;s prediction of the bending of starlight in the sun&#39;s gravitational field, to the design of the delicate gyroscopes now being prepared for a critical space shuttle experiment in the 1990s.</p><p>A revised and updated edition of the acclaimed account for general readers of how Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity holds up after more than seventy years.First published in 1986, this award-winning account of how Einstein&#39;s theory holds up after more than seventy-five years has been updated to accomodate the most recent experimental findings, as well as the exciting story of the rise and fall of the &#34;fifth force&#34;.</p><h2>From the Heart of Darkness</h2><p>This is the true first edition.

Beginning in the period of his life when he wrote <em>Kathleen and Frank</em>, his first intensely personal book, <em>Liberation: Diaries 1970&#x2013;1983</em> intimately and wittily records Isherwood's immersion in the 1970s art scene in Los Angeles, New York, and London&#x2014;a world peopled by the likes of Robert Rauschenberg, Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol, and David Hockney, as well as his Broadway writing career, which brought him in touch with John Huston, Merchant and Ivory, John Travolta, John Voight, Elton John, David Bowie, Joan Didion, and Armistead Maupin. With a preface by Edmund White, <em>Liberation</em> is a rich and engaging final memoir by one of the most celebrated writers of his generation.</p></p><p><p>"A slip of a wild boy: with quick silver eyes," as Virginia Woolf saw him in the 1930s, Christopher Isherwood journeyed and changed with his century, until, by the 1980s, he was celebrated as the finest prose writer in English and the grand old man of gay liberation. In this final volume of his diaries, the capstone of a million-word masterwork, Isherwood greets advancing age with poignant humor and an unquenchable appetite for the new; even aches, illnesses, and diminishing powers are clues to a predicament still unfathomed. The mainstays of his mature contentment&#x2014;his Hindu guru, Swami Prabhavananda, and his long-term companion, Don Bachardy&#x2014;draw from him an unexpected high tide of joy and love.</p><p>Around his private religious and domestic routines orbit gifted friends both anonymous and infamous. Bachardy's burgeoning career pulled Isherwood into the 1970s art scenes in Los Angeles, New York, and London, where we meet Rauschenberg, Ruscha, and Warhol (serving fetid meat for lunch), as well as Hockney (adored) and Kitaj. Collaborating with Bachardy on scripts for the prizewinning <em>Frankenstein</em> and the Broadway fiasco <em>A Meeting by the River</em>, Isherwood extended his ties in Hollywood and in the theater world. John Huston, Merchant and Ivory, John Travolta, David Bowie, John Voight, Armistead Maupin, Elton John, and Joan Didion each take a turn through Isherwood's densely populated human comedy, sketched with both ruthlessness and benevolence against the background of the Vietnam War, the energy crisis, and the Nixon, Carter, and Reagan White Houses.</p><p>In <em>Kathleen and Frank</em>, his first book of this period, Isherwood unearthed the family demons that haunted his fugitive youth. When contemporaries began to die, he responded in <em>Christopher and His Kind and My Guru and His Disciple</em> with startling fresh truths about shared experiences. These are the most concrete and the most mysterious of his diaries, candidly revealing the fear of death that crowded in past Isherwood's fame, and showing how his lifelong immersion in the day-to-day lifted him, paradoxically, toward transcendence.</p><p>Christopher Isherwood (1904&#x2013;1986) was one of the most prominent writers of his generation. He is the author of many works of fiction, including <em>All the Conspirators</em>, <em>The Memorial</em>, <em>Mr. Norris Changes Trains</em>, and <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em>, on which the musical <em>Cabaret</em> was based, as well as works of nonfiction and biography.</p></p><h2>Mr. Kill (A Sergeants Sue�o and Bascom Novel)</h2><p><p>On a crowded train from Pusan to Seoul, the brutal rape of a young mother sparks rage on the powder-keg peninsula of Korea, pitting&nbsp;Koreans against Americans&nbsp;and the 8th Army brass against the truth.&nbsp; Eyewitness accounts indicate the culprit was most likely a U.S. serviceman, but by the time Sergeants George Sueno and Ernie Bascom, U.S. Army investigators, are called in, the rapist has disappeared and anti-American fervor in this proud Asian country is threatening to explode.<br>&nbsp;<br>George and Ernie search in vain for the culprit, all the while becoming entangled in the web of military apologists who deny that any Americans were involved, and the designs of a beautiful blonde musician who fronts an all-female country western band--a woman who is out to entertain the troops in more ways than one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Delay causes more tragedy--and this time murder--and sets off a frantic search for a killer that stretches from the sizzling hot Demilitarized Zone to the cold waters of the Yellow Sea and introduces George Sueno and Ernie Bascom to a ruthless Korean homicide investigator known to anyone foolish enough to cross him as Mr. Kill.</p></p><p><b>Martin Lim�n</b>&nbsp;retired from military service after twenty years in the US Army, including ten years in Korea.

He lives near Seattle.1<br> &nbsp;<br> Hot metal shrieked as the Blue Train express from Pusan<br> braked its way into the vast yard of Seoul-<i>yok</i>, the downtown<br> Seoul Railroad Station. Someone barked an order.<br> Two squads of khaki-clad Korean National Policemen<br> fanned out along the cement platform, prowling like<br> shadows through roiling clouds of vapor.<br><br> &#x201c;Whoever this guy is,&#x201d; Ernie told me, &#x201c;G.I. or not, he&#x2019;s<br> about to be introduced to a whole world of butt-kick.&#x201d;<br><br> My name is George Sue�o. I&#x2019;m an investigator for the<br> Criminal Investigation Division of the 8th United States<br> Army in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Myy partner, Ernie<br> Bascom, and I stood with our backs against brick, waiting<br> in this overcast afternoon for the arrival of a train that,<br> according to railroad authorities, held tragedy. The Blue<br> Train engineer radioed ahead that a female passenger in<br> car number three had been threatened with a knife and<br> raped. She was found by one of the stewardesses cowering<br> in the lavatory, too incoherent to give much information,<br> but claiming that the perpetrator had been a&nbsp;<i>kocheingi</i>. A<br> big-nose. In other words, a foreigner.<br><br> In the early seventies, what with 700,000 fire-breathing<br> Communist soldiers on the far side of the DMZ just thirty<br> miles north of here, there weren&#x2019;t many tourists in the<br> Republic of Korea. Nor were there many European businessmen,<br> and only a smattering of diplomats. The foreigners<br> most likely to be using the Blue Train on this Monday<br> morning were&nbsp;<i>Miguk</i>s. Americans. And those Americans<br> were most likely to be among the 50,000 or so G.I.s who<br> fell under the jurisdiction of the 8th United States Army.<br> Therefore, the call had been made by the Korean National<br> Police to us, the agents of 8th Army CID.<br><br> Exactly who this guy was, we didn&#x2019;t know. All we knew<br> for sure was that the crime had been committed sometime<br> after the Blue Train pulled out of Taejon. Between there<br> and here, no stops. The Blue Line takes about four hours<br> and fifty minutes, total, to travel the almost 400 kilometers<br> from Pusan to Seoul, with only two brief layovers,<br> the first at the East Taegu Station and the second at Taejon.<br> At each scheduled stop, the train pauses for less than five<br> minutes. After leaving Taejon, whoever perpetrated this<br> crime would&#x2019;ve had no way to get off the train. Therefore,<br> we were assuming, as were all these Korean cops, that he<br> was still aboard.<br><br> Lieutenant Shin, the officer in charge of the KNP<br> detail, told me that the engineer had further explained<br> that the victim was a young mother with two children<br> in tow. Apparently, she&#x2019;d left her son and her daughter in<br> their seats while she used the bathroom. That&#x2019;s where she&#x2019;d<br> been assaulted. The rapist forced his way into the small<br> bathroom behind her and threatened her with a knife,<br> slicing the flesh of her throat superficially. The blood<br> and the blade had convinced her to comply with what he<br> demanded. Everything he demanded.<br><br> The cops in Lieutenant Shin&#x2019;s detail already knew that<br> a woman with children had been assaulted by someone<br> they assumed to be an American G.I. They weren&#x2019;t happy<br> about such a non-Confucian crime being committed in<br> broad daylight in a public place, and they allowed their<br> anger to show when they glared at Ernie and at me, as if<br> we were somehow responsible.<br><br> Steam puffed from the sides of the train. With a huge<br> sigh, the big engine shut down. Usually, even before<br> wheels stop rolling, people would already be hopping off<br> metal steps, hurrying to beat the crowd filtering toward<br> the front gate of the main station. Today, eerily, nobody<br> moved. If I hadn&#x2019;t been able to make out seated silhouettes<br> through the fog-smudged windows, I would&#x2019;ve thought it<br> was a train full of ghosts.<br><br> Lieutenant Shin barked more orders, and two cops<br> took up positions at the ends of each passenger car. Other<br> cops covered the opposite side of the train. Thus surrounded,<br> all possibility of escape was eliminated.<br><br> Behind us, on the overhead ramparts, a crowd gathered,<br> people waiting for other trains. Some of the civilians<br> murmured loudly about&nbsp;<i>Miguk-nom</i>, base American<br> louts. Somehow they&#x2019;d gotten wind of what had happened.<br><br> Accompanied by Lieutenant Shin, Ernie and I climbed<br> aboard the first passenger car. The head conductor, wearing<br> a high-collared black coat and pillbox hat, was already<br> waiting. He was a craggy-faced man, middle-aged, with<br> his feet planted shoulder-width apart as if from years of<br> pacing up and down rocking central aisles.<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in car three,&#x201d; he said in Korean. I translated for<br> Ernie. &#x201c;The children are confused,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;They<br> know something happened to their mother, something<br> bad, but they don&#x2019;t know what.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Has the perpetrator been identified?&#x201d; Lieutenant Shin<br> asked.<br><br> &#x201c;No. All she told the stewardess was that he&#x2019;s a kocheingi.&#x201d;<br> He glanced toward Ernie and me. I nodded for him<br> to continue. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in her seat, huddled with her children.<br> So far, she refuses to move.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Take us,&#x201d; Lieutenant Shin told him.<br><br> We followed the conductor down the center aisle. As<br> we did so, row after row of Asian faces turned up to us,<br> some of them frightened, more of them angry. I heard<br> epithets whispered, a few familiar, a few I&#x2019;d never heard<br> before.<br><br> &#x201c;Tough crowd,&#x201d; Ernie mumbled behind me.<br><br> As we passed from car to car, Ernie and I checked the<br> bathrooms, just to make sure no one was hiding in them.<br> No one was. They were small, locked from the inside, and<br> under normal circumstances barely large enough to hold<br> one person.<br><br> Finally we entered car three and stopped. A gaggle of<br> grandmothers, clad in traditional Korean dresses, surrounded<br> two of the seats. As we approached, they turned<br> their headsand, one by one, faces soured. Wrinkled eyes<br> evaluated me, finding me in some way disgusting, flashing<br> disapproval&#x2014;at me, and at the crime that had been<br> perpetrated on this Blue Train from Pusan.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t me, I wanted to shout. Although I&#x2019;ve been<br> falsely accused before, and I know the sick feeling in the<br> gut, I&#x2019;ve never in my life threatened anyone with a knife&#x2014;<br> nor have I raped anyone. I stifled the urge to scream at<br> these women. I&#x2019;m a cop, not a rapist. Ernie fidgeted behind<br> me. Americans are generally welcome in Korea. It wasn&#x2019;t<br> often that we faced such hatred, but we were feeling it<br> now&#x2014;down to our bones.<br><br> Lieutenant Shin stepped forward, breaking the silence.<br> With a rustle of silk, angry grandmothers stepped away.<br><br> The victim was a petite woman, five foot two or three,<br> maybe just slightly over a hundred pounds. She sat huddled<br> with her two children, the boy about four, the girl<br> about six. She wouldn&#x2019;t look up. Lieutenant Shin spoke to<br> her softly.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you hurt badly?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br> &#x201c;Can you show me where you&#x2019;re cut?&#x201d;<br><br> The children stared at us with wide, worried eyes.<br> When the woman still wouldn&#x2019;t answer, Lieutenant Shin<br> reached out and touched her arm. Like a startled spider,<br> she flinched, curling herself into a tiny ball. The children<br> clung more tightly to their mother and started to cry.<br> That&#x2019;s when I saw it. Blood. On the side of her neck. The<br> wound hadn&#x2019;t been completely stanched. The blood trickled<br> slowly down the side of her small neck, staining the<br> round collar of her dress, pooling against bone.<br><br> The grandmothers had had enough. They pushed<br> themselves between Lieutenant Shin and the woman,<br> shooing him away.<br><br> He refused to back off. The authority of the elderly in a<br> Confucian society like Korea is great, but not greater than<br> the law. Still, the presence of two kocheingis was making<br> his job more difficult. He motioned with his eyes for Ernie<br> and me to continue on ahead of him toward the rear of<br> the car. We did, passing another surly group of passengers<br> craning their necks to see what was going on.<br><br> According to the conductor, the bathroom at the back<br> of the car was where the crime had been committed. A<br> nervous stewardess in a stylish blue skirt, white blouse,<br> and matching blue cap explained in Korean that more than<br> an hour ago she&#x2019;d received complaints from other passengers<br> that someone was in the bathroom and wouldn&#x2019;t<br> come out. The stewardess investigated, pounded on the<br> door, and finally coaxed whoever was inside to open up.<br> She found the victim crouched on the floor, dress ripped,<br> blood seeping from a slice on the side of her neck, covering<br> her face with splayed fingers. The stewardess immediately<br> reported the incident to the head conductor. Together<br> they bandaged the wound and, after much coaxing, managed<br> to escort the devastated woman out of the bathroom<br> and down the aisle to her seat.<br><br> &#x201c;Did you see the foreigner?&#x201d; I asked the stewardess.<br><br> She shook her head.<br><br> &#x201c;Did you or the conductor see an American up here in<br> car three?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No. And neither did any of the passengers. They&#x2019;ve<br> been talking among themselves nonstop since this thing<br> happened. Only now, because the police are here, are<br> they quiet.&#x201d;<br><br> The Korean National Police are a mixed blessing. They<br> maintain order, plenty of it. But sometimes they maintain<br> that order at a high price, especially if you&#x2019;re on the receiving<br> end of a polished wooden nightstick.<br><br> &#x201c;So no one saw a foreigner in car three?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> The stewardess nodded. I explained what she&#x2019;d said to<br> Ernie. He pushed open a door, and air rushed into the car.<br> We both studied the metal walkway leading back toward<br> car four.<br><br> &#x201c;Where are the Americans?&#x201d; I asked the stewardess.<br><br> At the RTO, 8th Army&#x2019;s Rail Transportation Office,<br> tickets are issued free to G.I.s on official travel and sold<br> at a discounted rate to those on leave or pass or other<br> forms of unofficial travel. Eighth Army&#x2019;s policy is to try,<br> whenever possible, to keep all the Americans in the same<br> passenger car.<br><br> The stewardess showed us with her eyes, glancing back<br> at car four.<br><br> Lieutenant Shin approached. While the stewardess<br> went over the same ground with him, I crouched and<br> studied the interior of the bathroom. There wasn&#x2019;t much<br> to be seen. A little splashed water. A low toilet&#x2014;porcelain<br> embedded in the floor, Korean style, made for squatting; a<br> small sink; and an unraveled roll of paper.<br><br> In the center aisle, men in blue smocks were trundling<br> toward us. Stenciled on their chests, in white block&nbsp;<i>hangul</i><br> letters, was the word&nbsp;<i>Kyongchal</i>. Police. Keeping his voice<br> low so the female victim couldn&#x2019;t hear, Lieutenant Shin<br> briefed them. These were the technicians who would be<br> searching the bathroom for traces of blood or semen or<br> hair. I was impressed. So was Ernie. In the Itaewon bar district,<br> loaded with business girls who catered to American<br> G.I.s, rape wasn&#x2019;t taken nearly as seriously. As the technicians<br> placed their gear on the floor and squatted down<br> to get to work, one of the them said in Korean, &#x201c;First the<br> mother of our country, and now this.&#x201d;<br><br> Lieutenant Shin stationed a young cop near the bathroom<br> to make sure that no one interfered with the crime<br> scene or with the technicians.<br><br> What we did next was what Ernie&#x2019;d been aching to do<br> since we arrived at Seoul Station, ever since we&#x2019;d been subjected<br> to the hatred in the eyes of the masses of Koreans<br> surrounding us: he reached in his pocket and pulled out a<br> shining set of brass knuckles. Slipping them over his fingers,<br> he clenched his fist, enjoying the fit and the satisfying<br> heft of the finely crafted metal. Satisfied, he nodded. Lieutenant<br> Shin took the lead. Together, we entered car four.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Autumn had fallen quickly in Korea. This was not unusual<br> in itself&#x2014;seasons change rapidly on the Korean Peninsula&#x2014;<br> but it had also fallen early. Gray clouds appeared,<br> and gloomy winds started to blow. A week and a half ago,<br> August 15, had been the 29th anniversary of Korea&#x2019;s liberation<br> from the occupying forces of the Japanese Imperial<br> Army. The Japanese had taken over the country in 1910,<br> stripping the Korean monarchy and the Korean legislature<br> of any real power, and ruled the entire peninsula as a<br> colony until 1945.<br><br> To mark this all-important day, Pak Chung-hee, the<br> former Army colonel and current authoritarian president<br> of South Korea, had given a speech to a packed hall.<br><br> Unfortunately, a Japanese national, believed to be in<br> the employ of North Korea, smuggled a gun into the hall<br> and took a few potshots at the president. Pak Chung-hee<br> crouched behind his heavily fortified podium and was not<br> harmed. His security guards, however, pulled their own<br> weapons and returned fire, and for a few mad seconds<br> hot lead zinged all over the auditorium. One of the bullets<br> struck the head of Yuk Young-soo, the wife of the president,<br> who&#x2019;d been sitting on the stage only a few feet from<br> her husband. She was rushed to the hospital but declared<br> dead on arrival.<br><br> Like most first ladies around the world, Yuk Young-soo<br> was popular, much more popular than her husband. The<br> death of such a vital woman, the mother of three young<br> children, shocked the country, sending it into mourning.<br> Only hours after she died, the blue skies of summer disappeared<br> with the onset of autumn.<br><br> Does a country have a mood? Maybe. Maybe not. We<br> only read our own moods into what we see around us. But<br> if countries do have moods, the mood of the Republic of<br> Korea was surly right now. Surly to the point of tipping<br> over into rage.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> As we entered car four, rows of passengers gaped at us.<br> They were mostly Koreans, but there were a few American<br> faces scattered among them. While Lieutenant Shin and<br> the ranking sergeant in his detail asked for identification<br> and briefly interviewed the Korean nationals, Ernie and I<br> studied the Americans. The faces were confused and concerned,<br> but nobody bolted for the door.<br><br> I pulled out my badge and held it up.<br><br> &#x201c;Good morning, everyone. I&#x2019;m Agent Sue�o. This is<br> Agent Bascom. We&#x2019;re going to be asking you some questions.<br> First, I&#x2019;d like everyone to pull out their identification<br> and their travel orders.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What if you don&#x2019;t have travel orders?&#x201d; one of the G.I.s<br> asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Then your leave orders will have to do,&#x201d; Ernie replied.<br><br> Every American G.I. had to be able to prove that he had<br> permission to be away from his compound. If he didn&#x2019;t,<br> we&#x2019;d report him to his unit and non-judicial punishment<br> could ensue. This was punishment short of court-martial,<br> like restriction to the barracks or forfeiture of pay for less<br> than thirty days.<br><br> While Ernie stayed inside the car, I took the American<br> pass...</p><h2>Beware of Pity (European Classics)</h2><p>After Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig was perhaps the most well-known and widely read author writing in German before the Nazi period. <i>Beware of Pity</i> was written in Zweig's London exile in 1938, and although it is above all a psychological novel whose tragedy unfolds in the private realms, Zweig's humanistic perspective provides a commentary on the larger historical and political situation.<br><br>The main action is set in 1914 in the months leading up to World War I. Anton Hofmiller, an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, consents to marry Edith, the crippled daughter of a wealthy local family. Immediately regretting his assent, remorseful yet refusing responsibility, he denies the news of his engagement to his comrades. His weakness of character and his selfish, superficial pity for Edith drive the woman to commit suicide and break her father's heart.<br></p><p>Stefan Zweig was born in 1881 in what then was Austria-Hungary and committed suicide with is wife in Brazil in 1942 after being forced to flee Nazi-held Europe.

The critic Harold Bloom has included Kushner's play in his "Western canon" alongside Shakespeare and the Bible, and drama scholar John M. Clum has termed it "a turning point in the history of gay drama, the history of American drama, and of American literary culture." While we might be somewhat wary of the instant canonization that such critical assessments confer, clearly Kushner's play is an important work, honored by the Pulitzer Prize, thought worthy of recognition on "purely aesthetic" grounds at the same time that it has been embraced--and occasionally rejected--for its politics.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>Kushner's play explicitly positions itself in the current American conflict over identity politics, yet also situates that debate in a broader historical context: the American history of McCarthyism, of immigration and the "melting pot," of westward expansion, and of racist exploitation. Furthermore, the play enters into the politically volatile struggles of the AIDS crisis, struggles themselves interconnected with the politics of sexuality, gender, race, and class.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>The original essays in <i>Approaching the Millennium</i> explore the complexities of the play and situate it in its particular, conflicted historical moment. The contributors help us understand and appreciate the play as a literary work, as theatrical text, as popular cultural phenomenon, and as political reflection and intervention. Specific topics include how the play thematizes gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity; the postmodern incarnation of the Brechtian epic; AIDS and the landscape of American politics. The range of different international productions of <i>Angels in America</i> provides a rich basis for discussion of its production history, including the linguistic and cultural shifts required in its "translation" from one stage to the next.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>The last section of <i>Approaching the Millennium</i> includes interviews with Tony Kushner and other key creators and players involved in the original productions of <i>Angels</i>. The interviews explore issues raised earlier in the volume and dialogues between the creative artists who have shaped the play and the critics and "theatricians" engaged in responding to it.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>Contributors to this volume are Arnold Aronson, Art Borreca, Gregory W.

One scholar termed it "a turning point in the history of gay drama, the history of American drama, and of American literary culture." The breadth of the play's thematic concerns, the originality of its construction and characterizations, and the multiple ambivalences of its message guarantee that it will provoke stimulating critical and scholarly discussion. These two volumes?the first works devoted entirely to Kushner to be published in the United States?represent a major step in the canonization of Kushner's "Gay Fantasia on National Themes." Geis and Kruger (both English, Queens Coll., CUNY) have grouped 18 essays?only two of which are reprints?into four categories: the play's political and historical themes; issues of racial, ethnic, and religious identity; apocalypse and the millennium; and performance contexts. Though all 18 are stimulating, the academic prose makes the collection appropriate only for collections supporting graduate or advanced undergraduate studies. Vorlicky (drama, New York Univ.) provides a major service by bringing together 22 interviews with Kushner, about half previously published (but several in ephemeral and nonacademic periodicals) and the others transcribed from television talk shows and symposia. The breadth of Kushner's interests and knowledge and the passion of his political and social commitments are on full display here. Reading the two collections together is particularly illuminating, as Kushner's own views at times both confirm and dampen the critical speculations of the scholars. Both volumes are mandatory for academic American literature, theater, or gay studies collections. Public libraries serving substantial gay male populations also should consider the collection of interviews.?Robert W. Melton, Univ. of Kansas Libs.

He expands on this intriguing hypothesis in several lengthy chapters, but with a lot of sloganistic phrases about "harmonic pathways" and "flow of drive" instead of scientific or logical argument--and his overview of canine domestication is surely ahistorical. The prey instinct, Behan argues, can be directed toward toys or even moving vehicles as well as other animals, and can be used to motivate a dog in training. His actual methods are not wholly original, but they are useful. Lessons offer a host of incentives to make and keep training a positive experience for dog and handler--at least, those handlers willing to entertain suggestions about "waking the puppy within." Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Trainer Behan says, "What is newly presented here is the idea that . . . the prey instinct" is the connecting and underlying theme in all canine behavior. Behan shows how to channel this prey instinct into desirable behavior through play sessions and basic obedience exercises. He also discusses training puppies, calming rambunctious dogs, and handling problem dogs. In the chapter "Kids and Puppies," he offers sound advice on teaching children and dogs to live in harmony. While Behan covers a wide range of topics, some owners will prefer John Ross and Barbara McKinney's Dog Talk ( LJ 5/15/92) . Both books tell owners how to refocus the dog's natural instincts, which inhibit learning, but the simpler, more detailed instructions in Dog Talk will appeal to the average dog owner. --Helen Sondrol, Lincoln Univ.

Half dreaming, he scrambled to piece together what was happening. His lanky body felt cockeyed and unresponsive. Even opening his eyes seemed impossible. As hallucination gave way to reality, he remembered his predicament: He was stranded in an inaccessible forest, on the wrong side of the raging Yu River, during the dangerous, unrelenting monsoon rains of 1927, and he had never been sicker.<br><br>His spiking fever was accompanied by chills. The lymph nodes at his groin were swollen to the size of fists, and some of the small pustules lining his feet and legs had broken open. For days he had been unable to eat and could barely drink. That morning he could not even stand.<br><br>As the lashing rains tore at his clothes, he suddenly felt something that he couldn&#x2019;t make sense of: His cot was lurching, as if it was trying to buck him off. Forcing his eyes open, Williams realized he was not on the wrong side of the river, but smack in the middle of it, riding an elephant through the churning avalanche of water. Around him, deadly two-ton tree trunks shot down the rapids like missiles, crashing into one another with a sound like thunder.<br><br>Blinking against the pouring rain, he seized the rail of the large bamboo cargo basket, or &#x201c;kah,&#x201d; he lay in as it rocked him back and forth, perilously close to the frothing current. The elephant was pitched at a steep angle, leaning his flank into the wall of water, shouldering all his weight against the chocolate-colored torrent in an effort to keep his footing. Yet Williams felt oddly lucky. That was because of the elephant he rode. There was no way Williams could mistake the animal&#x2019;s identity&#x2014;even in his feverish state, slumped high up in a basket. The broad expanse of the gray back, the delicate pink freckling bordering the ears, and the rakish slant of the gleaming white tusks, their tips just visible from this viewpoint&#x2014;this was the only elephant who could brave the crossing: the strongest and most stouthearted creature in the forest, the best friend Williams ever had. Bandoola.<br><br>Williams, who managed several teak logging camps, would eventually know a thousand elephants by name during his years with the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation. Of all of them, Bandoola was dearest to him, owing to his intelligence, virtue, and strength. Williams had confidence that even without a rider&#x2019;s guidance, &#x201c;the great elephant knew what he was doing,&#x201d; using his own instincts and judgment for this passage.<br><br>Not that a human voice could be heard over the pounding water, but Williams probably mustered the breath to at least whisper encouragement. He had made a habit of speaking to the working elephants in the language they were trained in&#x2014;Burmese. More than any other animal, he believed, they craved conversation. Their vocabularies, the number of words they understood, were astonishing, but to Williams, impressive as that was, there was something that counted more. These creatures could read underlying emotion, understand intent, perceive what was really being expressed. Now, verbalized or not, Williams would make plain to Bandoola that he was grateful and believed in him.<br><br>The bull already knew how ill Williams was. Earlier that day, the mahouts, or &#x201c;uzis&#x201d; as they were called here, who worked for Williams had cinched a cargo basket to Bandoola&#x2019;s back. It was an unusual event for the tusker, who was a logging elephant, not one of the small pack elephants called &#x201c;travelers.&#x201d; Nonetheless, he had stood patiently, head held high, ears flat against his neck, as the rain pelted his back and ran off his wrinkled hide in runnels. Soaking wet, his skin had inked into a deep purple. Elephants in Burma knew how to cope with monsoon. If he tilted his head forward, his large, bony brow ridge would shield his eyes from rain, and he could keep water from spilling into his nostrils by hanging his trunk down straight, curling it under at the very end. When a limp Williams was carried out of his tent, Bandoola&#x2019;s dark eyes, beneath their heavy, wrinkled lids and long lashes, tracked the movement, lending him the meditative look particular to elephants. Bandoola not only recognized Williams, he knew something was wrong. This person was different from the energetic, confident man who when visiting camp invariably produced a sugary tamarind ball treat for Bandoola, spoke to him, scrubbed his sandpaper skin exactly where it needed scratching, ran his hands along his hide, swabbed ointment on abrasions, and then slapped his flank good-bye. He had nursed Bandoola back to health for a whole year after a fight with another tusker, spending every day cleaning the wounds and applying antiseptic and fly repellent. Now Williams, the elephant saw, was as broken as Bandoola had been then.<br><br>The order &#x201c;Hmit!&#x201d; was given, and Bandoola sank down, back legs buckling first into the sludge, then the front. Several Burmese men, their colorful sarong-like longyis sodden with rain, struggled with slipping hands and feet to hoist the senseless Williams up to the basket atop Bandoola&#x2019;s shoulders. Two of them, Williams&#x2019;s closest servant, Aung Net, and another camp worker, would ride with him.<br><br>As the body was passed upward, Bandoola swiveled his trunk, pressing his nostrils to Williams, and breathing in deeply. Even through Williams&#x2019;s clothing Bandoola was picking up organic clues, especially from the armpits and between the legs. Like all elephants, he was a master chemist, analyzing much of the world through his sensitive nose. Bandoola could ascertain innumerable facts about any animal: last meal eaten, fitness, anxiety level, or hormonal state. Elephants read one another&#x2014;and people&#x2014;this way. Bandoola&#x2019;s prodigious brain, highly evolved to negotiate a complex social world, kept a dossier of the men around him, especially Williams, whom he had known for seven years. Scent was a critical part of that inventory. Williams&#x2019;s transformation into a seasoned forest man was telegraphed to Bandoola in large part by his body odor. Billy Williams smelled different as a veteran than he had as a recruit. Over time, his diet and smoking habits changed, the ratio of fat to muscle shifted, and his confidence around elephants grew, meaning certain hormones that often signaled fear were reduced. The city washed out of the man, and the jungle seeped in. When Williams had an opportunity for sex, Bandoola could smell that, too.<br><br>What Bandoola inhaled this day was misery. With just a few whiffs of Williams&#x2019;s body, the tusker processed the rank breath, the change in hygiene, and the yeasty scent of an infection. Elephants routinely help other ailing elephants, lifting them when they cannot stand, feeding them when they are unable to forage. Are they capable of doing the same for people? Williams couldn&#x2019;t prove Bandoola was aware of his dire condition, but it damn sure felt that way to him during his flashes of consciousness.<br><br>Like all the European teak men, Williams was a nomad of the forest. He knew illness and accident went with the job, that bouts of malaria were as frequent as colds were back home. Hundreds of miles&#x2014;roadless, muddy, rain-drenched, wooded, and mountainous&#x2014;from any medical help, he and his colleagues toughed out such episodes. Even the most robust among them could wither and die within days of something seemingly innocuous: a headache, a cut, a chill. &#x201c;No one who works in the jungle,&#x201d; Williams once wrote, &#x201c;calculates on a ripe old age as a near-certainty.&#x201d; The tropical forest was capricious in its blessings and curses. Indigenous people made sense of it with a pantheon of jungle sprites that they called &#x201c;nats&#x201d;: some cruel, sneaky, and slick, others kind and generous. The nats personified the soul of the forest.<br><br>Staying alive&#x2014;especially for outsiders like Williams&#x2014;took every trick a man could muster. The company&#x2019;s numbers told the story: Williams had been one of forty-one young recruits hired for the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation in 1920. Now, seven years later, only sixteen of them were still on the job. The others were either dead, dismissed, or disillusioned. Though he knew the attrition would continue, he hoped he wouldn&#x2019;t be the next to go. With Bandoola, at least he had a chance.<br><br>First, they had laboriously waded through nearly fifty miles of thick sludge. &#x201c;Each stage of that agonising trek was about ten miles,&#x201d; Williams wrote. &#x201c;At every step Bandoola sank two or three feet deep into the mud. Each foot he lifted made a loud sucking noise and even his gigantic powers were sorely taxed.&#x201d;<br><br>Then came the river. Progress was slow. The churning water was level with Bandoola&#x2019;s chest, and the animal had to pause before each stride, feeling the boulder-strewn riverbed with his feet for his next purchase. Often, he would freeze in place for what seemed like &#x201c;an eternity of time in the middle of the angry waters,&#x201d; as the current sloshed over his back, soaking Williams and the two men. Then Bandoola would find a foothold and lunge forward again. &#x201c;His massive head and tusks ploughed a passage through the water like the nose of a submarine,&#x201d; Williams wrote years later in one of the several memoirs he would produce. &#x201c;Riding on his powerful back brought home my own fragility.&#x201d;<br><br>Precarious as his situation was, Williams could not keep his eyes open. The fever pulled him back into oblivion, as, step-by-step, Bandoola made his way. By the time they reached the far shore, Williams was unconscious. Aung Net and his helper pulled him from the basket and dragged him to a hut. There were still maybe a hundred miles to go between them and a station with a doctor. Once he was awake, Williams would have to make a tough decision: whether to travel overland through impenetrable virgin forest, or by water, shooting down the dangerous rapids. Either way, he needed to reach the more populated banks of the mighty Chindwin, the river where, it seemed an eternity before, Williams had first met Bandoola and his life among elephants had begun.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Into the Jungle<br><br>On a crisp November day in 1920, James Howard Williams, called &#x201c;Billy&#x201d; by friends and &#x201c;Jim&#x201d; by his family, saw the Chindwin River for the first time. The waterway originated far to the north near the Himalayas, in the wild Hukawng Valley, and stretched for 750 miles, eventually spilling out into the even greater Irrawaddy River near Mandalay, Burma. The Chindwin, the history books and magazines promised, ran through savage country where villagers still practiced head-hunting, performed human sacrifices to appease the spirits of rice production, and could transform themselves into ghost cats. Famous explorers wrote of remote and little-known corners of the area that harbored barbaric tribes. It was enough to scare any of the new British recruits routinely hired by the logging companies. But Billy was different. Striking a match to one of his Players cigarettes and looking out over the water and the limitless jungle beyond, he was amused by such flights of imagination. A forest teeming with monsters? He knew better and had seen worse.<br><br>Tall, clean-shaven, and built like a loping hound, Williams may have looked young in his freshly pressed khakis, but he had been through the kind of hell that quickly burns away a man&#x2019;s innocence. Months earlier, on January 26, 1920, the British Army had demobilized him with the rank of captain. During four years of brutal, bitter fighting in the Great War as part of Devonshire Regiment, or the &#x201c;Bloody Eleventh,&#x201d; Billy had led other men into battle and served in several battlefronts in a wide sweep across North Africa, the Middle East, India, and Afghanistan. In the deserts of Egypt, he was part of the Camel Corps, facing the jihad raised by the Senussi, a group of Muslim guerilla fighters. Along the Tigris, he had been a bombing officer engaged in ghastly battles with the Ottoman Army as part of the Mesopotamia (Iraq) Campaign, in which close to one hundred thousand soldiers from the British and British Indian Armies died. Finally, in 1919, he endured his last two assignments. The first brought him into the turmoil of Lahore, India, where martial law was declared to quell rioting against the British. And later that year he fought hand to hand against fierce, well-armed tribesmen in Waziristan, a remote mountainous outpost on the border with Afghanistan.<br><br>He knew he was lucky to be alive. Nearly a million British soldiers had died in the Great War, and those who survived were forever changed. Some obviously so&#x2014;faces half blown off, hands trembling from shell shock, trouser legs folded neatly and tacked up where a leg should be. Others carried the trauma inside.<br><br>Billy Williams would never write or speak about his experiences in the war, for he had a lifelong tendency to lock away his deepest emotions, especially the painful ones. The less he talked about something, the closer it was to his heart. It wasn&#x2019;t in his nature to dwell on the darkness of combat. He wouldn&#x2019;t mention what ailed him, only what might cure him. When he came home, he said that the vision of Burma&#x2019;s lonely jungles, filled with wild animals, called to him. It was no surprise to his family. As social as he so often appeared, they knew that solitude was his true bent. He could do without the parties and pranks he was known for in school; in fact, he truly thrived in the kind of isolated wilderness that would turn other men mad.<br><br>His opportunity to do just that came from a chance meeting shortly before being discharged. An army buddy he was drinking with had a connection to a teak logging company and suggested an adventure in Burma. Williams fell in love with the idea even before locating the country on a map. Clinching it was the mention of elephants. &#x201c;My way has been from a very early age the companionship of animals,&#x201d; he once wrote.<br><br>His fondness extended to most creatures, but it was individual animals who affected him most deeply. He recognized their distinct personalities even when few others did. First, there was Prince, his childhood donkey, with whom he would wander the moors, hitching him up to a jingle, or carriage. &#x201c;I developed a longing for big open spaces,&#x201d; Williams wrote, &#x201c;and used to talk it over with old Prince who seemed to understand.&#x201d; The donkey, he said, &#x201c;was the first animal with which I enjoyed a joke.&#x201d; When he left Prince to go off to boarding school, he was bereft, feeling that the separation created a &#x201c;blank in life.&#x201d;<br><br>In wartime, he &#x201c;really fell in love&#x201d; with his camel named Frying Pan. And of more than one dog, he would simply say, &#x201c;We loved each other dearly.&#x201d; When circumstances such as school or war uprooted him, the worst part was saying good-bye to a pet. It created an emotional tear he believed could be mended only by time and the company of another animal. But an elephant? Was he really up to that kind of challenge?</p><h2>Supermen!: The First Wave Of Comic Book Heroes 1936-1941</h2><p>The enduring cultural phenomenon of comic book heroes was invented in the late 1930s by a talented and hungry group of artists and writers barely out of their teens, flying by the seat of their pants to create something new, exciting, and above all profitable. The iconography and mythology they created flourishes to this day in comic books, video, movies, fine art, advertising, and practically all other media. Supermen! collects the best and the brightest of this first generation, including Jack Cole, Will Eisner, Bill Everett, Lou Fine, Fletcher Hanks, Jack Kirby, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, and Basil Wolverton. If the reader is expecting to find an All-American group of altruistic do-gooders, he in for quite a jolt. As Jonathan Lethem writes in his Foreword, &#x201c;A collection like Supermen! works like a reverse-neutron bomb to assumptions about the birth of the superhero image: it tears down the orderly structures of theory and history and leaves the figures standing in full view, staring back at us in all their defiant disorienting particularity, their blazing strangeness.&#x201d; Beautifully designed and produced in full color, Supermen! contains twenty full-length stories, ten full- sized covers, and a generous selection of vintage promotional ads, and is indispensable to anyone interested in the origins of superheroes and the history of the comic book form.</p><p><p><strong>Greg Sadowski</strong> is a writer, editor and designer (<em>B.

Although they have met only a few times, Voss and Laura are joined by overwhelming, obsessive feelings for one another.</p><p>PATRICK WHITE (1912-1990), an Australian novelist and playwright, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973. His novel <i>The Vivisector</i> was shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010.<i><br>From the introduction</i><br> <i><br><br>&nbsp;</i><br> <b>Introduction</b><br> <b><br>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i>Out on the wastes of the Never-Never, </i><br> <i>That&#x2019;s where the dead men lie! </i><br> <i>That&#x2019;s where the heat-waves dance for ever &#x2013; </i><br> <i>That&#x2019;s where the dead men lie!</i><br> Barcroft Boake, <i>Where the Dead Men Lie</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Human relationships are vast as deserts</i><br> Patrick White, <i>Voss</i><br>&nbsp; <br><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Patrick White is one of the great novelists of the twentieth century, on a par with his fellow Nobel Laureates William Faulkner, Halld�r Laxness and Thomas Mann; and yet, one hundred years after his birth, his name seems temporarily and inexplicably lost in the immense desert spaces to which he introduced a new generation of readers, buried like one of those legions of Herodotus, beneath the glare and flies and red Australian sand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unsentimental, White predicted as much for himself. In 1981 after yet another project to film <i>Voss</i> had aborted, he wrote to the director Joseph Losey: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a dated novelist, whom hardly anyone reads, or if they do, most of them don&#x2019;t understand what I am on about. Certainly I wish I&#x2019;d never written <i>Voss</i>, which is going to be everybody&#x2019;s albatross. You could have died of him, somewhere in an Australian desert, so it&#x2019;s fortunate you were frustrated.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> To those who believe in the replenishing powers of fiction to lead you into a region different from any that you have been capable of imagining hitherto, and then to leave you, if for a flicker, with an uplifting sense that you are yourself a slightly different person (while paradoxically someone who understands themselves a little better), the fading of White&#x2019;s reputation is a stain. It was through works like <i>Voss</i> and his other &#x2018;historical&#x2019; masterpiece <i>A Fringe of Leaves</i> &#x2013; plus novels like <i>The Tree of Man</i>, <i>Riders in the Chariot </i>and <i>The Vivisector</i> &#x2013; that White pioneered a new and absolutely necessary fictional landscape.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think I could have survived without Patrick White,&#x2019; said one of his friends in Sydney, Joan Masterman, &#x2018;because he wrote in a way no one else did about Australia. He was the first white author to express through his characters the huge connection the Australian bush has on one&#x2019;s psyche.&#x2019; His best material might be drawn from local watering holes and billabongs, from Faulkner&#x2019;s native postage stamp of soil as it were; his reach is anything but local.<br> &nbsp;<br> To the singer Van Morrison, in Ireland, White was one of the greatest influences on his life. He was the recipient of the only fan letter that Salman Rushdie has written (after finishing Voss); as well, of an impromptu speech from the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, for whom reading Voss was a searing experience. &#x2018;It is like using an iron crow-bar at minus sixty-five degrees centigrade in Siberia: when you let go, part of the skin adheres to it. Part of me went to Voss and blood too.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> White, he was saying, does more than get under your skin; in his best work, he flays the reader bare.<br> &nbsp;<br> *<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I am never altogether happy if I do not know about past stages in the lives of my characters.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> White might have introduced &#x2018;a new continent into literature&#x2019;, to quote from his Nobel citation, yet his friend Barry Humphries called him &#x2018;more Kensington than any man I know in Australia&#x2019;. He was conceived in England, on Bisley plain, where his parents had gone to watch the shooting, and born at 11 a.m. on 28 May 1912 in their flat overlooking Hyde Park. He was baptised Patrick &#x2013; a name he hated as much as his appearance, which has been compared to anything from a basilisk to a sea-lion &#x2013; and, until he was twenty, known as Paddy &#x2013; a name he detested still more. He had not a drop of Irish in him. &#x2018;A Londoner is what I think I am at heart, but my blood is Australian and that&#x2019;s what keeps me going.&#x2019; He was six months old when his parents took him to Australia for the first time.<br> &nbsp;<br> He came from a family where &#x2018;to become any kind of artist would have been unthinkable&#x2019;. His parents were second cousins, descended on both sides from Somerset yeoman farmers who had sailed to New South Wales in the early nineteenth century and received generous land grants. The Whites were not literary: his father Dick read the stud-book, the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and detective stories. From Dick White, a tubby and indolent grazier whose principal passion was horses, he inherited his pale blue eyes and an income that permitted him freedom to write his &#x2018;peculiar&#x2019; books that none of his White cousins could ever quite finish (&#x2018;I ... would be in the gutter if it weren&#x2019;t for the Perpetual Trustees&#x2019;); from his ambitious gritty mother, Ruth Withycombe &#x2013; a lover of theatre, hats and terriers, who was prone to admonishing him with a horse whip &#x2013; his prickliness and violent temper. Tickled by a legend that a Withycombe might have been a fool to Edward II, White assumed for himself the licence to pen the unsayable. &#x2018;Anything I may have certainly comes from the Withycombe side.&#x2019; This included the weak lungs which had brought the Withycombes out to Australia in the first place. Asthma would be the curse and defining force of a life which, from early childhood, &#x2018;nobody would insure&#x2019;. In his acceptance speech to the Swedish Academy in 1973 White wrote: &#x2018;Probably induced by asthma I started reading and writing early on.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of White&#x2019;s &#x2018;great reads&#x2019; as a boy was the dictionary. &#x2018;My own explosive vocabulary was born in my early childhood &#x2013; by life out of the dictionary.&#x2019; Aged seven he ran to look up a word after a visit to Tasmania. White was hiding in the raspberry bushes near Browns River when he overheard a woman speaking about him: &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;s one of theirs. He&#x2019;s like a changeling.&#x2019; Throughout his life, he never sloughed off the impression of being someone else&#x2019;s child, an outcast and a refugee (&#x2018;refugees are in contact with life,&#x2019; he liked to say). Nor did he stop eavesdropping. &#x2018;His antennae are so good,&#x2019; recalled another friend, Ninette Dutton, &#x2018;that you can go out with him in the morning, buy some coffee, go to a couple of galleries, get the bus home, and he has accumulated enough material for a week.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Not only asthma and basilisk looks set him apart. There was his Australianness, &#x2018;the deformity I carried around&#x2019; &#x2013; like the hunchback of his Withycombe grandmother (and of Palfreyman&#x2019;s sister in <i>Voss</i>); there was his vocation as an artist in a land which cherished swimmers and athletes to an unmerciful degree; and there was his homosexuality. &#x2018;As a homosexual I have always known what it is to be an outsider. It has given me added insight into the plight of the immigrant &#x2013; the hate and contempt with which he is often received.&#x2019; And not only the immigrant: &#x2018;Ambivalence has given me insights into human nature, denied, I believe, to those who are unequivocally male or female.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> That White was also &#x2018;the greatest pessimist on earth&#x2019; he ascribed to a bush fire that he witnessed in the Southern Highlands, barely three months after his arrival in Australia, which destroyed the hotel he was staying in and from which he was rescued, in the nick of time, by his nanny. This was Patrick White&#x2019;s truer baptismal moment. From the instant of his rescue, he coupled a permanent apprehension of danger with an abiding affection for Nanny Galloway&#x2019;s replacement, a dark-haired Scots girl from Carnoustie. From the Presbyterian Lizzie Clark, he learned his moral code, which is that of the explorer Voss, and of Voss&#x2019;s &#x2018;twin obsessive&#x2019; Laura Trevelyan. To quell vanity and pride; to pursue simplicity and honesty; to conquer a harrowing sense of unworthiness; and, in as much as his changeling nature would allow, to love. &#x2018;All genuine love was directed at this substitute of a mother,&#x2019; he wrote. &#x2018;She was my real mother.&#x2019; In the White cosmos, love would always be synonymous with service.<br> &nbsp;<br> At any rate, he came to look back on his close encounter with death as a germinating flash in which, like any healthy native gum-tree or bottle-brush, was contained the regenerative seed of future life. It is the scorching kernel of <i>The Aunt&#x2019;s Story</i>, perhaps White&#x2019;s favourite of his novels (possibly because he felt it to be the most ignored): &#x2018;We must destroy everything, everything, even ourselves. Then at last when there is nothing perhaps we shall live.&#x2019; It lies also at the core of <i>Voss</i>, arguably the greatest of his novels: &#x2018;To make yourself, it is also necessary to destroy yourself.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> *<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;My novels usually begin with characters; you have them floating about in your head and it may be years before they get together in a situation.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He claims to have conceived Voss during the London Blitz, in a bedsitter in Ebury Street, close to where he was born, as German bombs rained down. But Voss&#x2019;s lineaments can be discerned further back, in a poem about a &#x2018;mad Messiah&#x2019; that White wrote at Cheltenham College, where his mother had sent him at thirteen for an English education, and in which he tried to make sense of &#x2018;the emotional chaos of which I was in possession&#x2019;. In that poem, a man with &#x2018;wild eyes and flowing beard&#x2019; cries out: &#x2018;I am the Resurrection and the Life.&#x2019; At school in Cheltenham (which he remembered as &#x2018;a prison&#x2019;) and afterwards at King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, White looked just like Voss &#x2013; thin, angular, with those blue eyes &#x2013; and behaved in the same prickly and perverse way. &#x2018;He didn&#x2019;t like himself very much, and had times of loathing himself,&#x2019; said his cousin Betty Withycombe. &#x2018;His mouth was always set very hard. He had a strain of stubbornness in him.&#x2019; The historian Manning Clark passed him once in Sydney, walking down George Street, and was taken aback by White&#x2019;s expression. &#x2018;It is the face of a man who wants something he is never going to get . . . something possibly no human being can give him.&#x2019; But what? Clark ruminated: &#x2018;a hunger for forgiveness in a man who places himself, through his pride and pessimism, beyond the reach of forgiveness.&#x2019; Of himself, White did once go so far as to acknowledge that &#x2018;in some ways I suppose I am very Victorian&#x2019;. He admitted of the novel which would take him another sixteen years to finish &#x2013; &#x2018;the book that has been wrung out of me in sweat and blood&#x2019; &#x2013; that all its characters were aspects of him- self, but none more so than the figure &#x2018;conceived by the perverse side of my nature&#x2019;. In Johann Ulrich Voss, &#x2018;there is more of my own character than anybody else&#x2019;s&#x2019;.</p><h2>Robert Kennedy and His Times</h2><p>Schlesinger, historian and friend of Bobby Kennedy, has had access for the first time to private papers, letters, and journals which make possible a fresh look at both personal relationships and public events.

In this wryly affectionate book, Hofmann reveals his adopted countrymen in all their glorious paradoxes, capturing their national essence as no other book has done since Luigi Barzini's classic, <i>The Italians</i>. The national art of "arrangement"-- dodging taxes, double-dealing, working only as hard as one must-- is counteracted by Italian inventive genius, gusto for life, fierce individuality, deep family bonds (as well as animosities), and a marvelously hedonistic sophistication.</p></p><p><b>Paul Hofmann</b> was for many years chief of the <i>New York Times</i> bureau in Rome. A resident of Italy on and off since World War II, he now lives in Rome, writing articles and books. The most recent, <i>Cento </i><i>Citt�</i>, a guide to Italy's smaller cities and towns, is now an Owl paperback (Holt, 1990).Continuing his love affair with Italy, Hofmann ( Cento Citta ), former New York Times Rome bureau chief, offers an entertaining and shrewd appraisal of an ancient, ever-changing nation. Although indulgent of the Italian scene, he nonetheless recognizes the blemishes that mar its surface and the violent contrasts that perplex many visitors, especially the cultural differences and tensions between the progressive North and the still semi-feudal, Mafia-plagued South. Strikes, erratic museum and public service schedules and civic red tape and delays, along with ugly, noisy urban sprawls surrounding traffic-jammed ancient cities, he grants, are exasperating. However, the author counters, these astute, individualistic, resilient people who value life moment by moment and cultivate its pleasures with a rare tenacity survive by resourcefulness (" arrangiarsi ") and by maintaining strong family bonds (despite much-publicized sex scandals). <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Farming in Anne Arundel County (Images of America)</h2><p>Since early settlers landed on Maryland&#x2019;s shores, agriculture has played a vital role in shaping the colony and state. Founded in 1650 in central Maryland, Anne Arundel County is home to Annapolis, the state&#x2019;s capital. Spanning 416 square miles and boasting 533 miles of Chesapeake Bay coastline, the county was once dotted with pastoral farming villages where tobacco was the major cash crop. In time, farmers diversified and adapted their craft and products to meet the demands of an ever-changing world. By the mid-1900s, truck crops became a leading agricultural commodity as farmers began to raise livestock and other produce to supplement their income. The county&#x2019;s proximity to Washington, DC, and Baltimore created job opportunities that led to suburban expansion, and by the late 20th century, tobacco&#x2015;once the backbone of Maryland agriculture&#x2015;was replaced by other crops. Images of America: Farming in Anne Arundel County chronicles the county&#x2019;s rich agricultural history and transformation through images collected from farm families and historical organizations.</p><p>For more than 30 years, author Frederick H. Doepkens taught agricultural science for Baltimore County public schools. His love of agriculture stems from growing up on his family&#x2019;s diversified crops and livestock/tobacco farm in Davidsonville in Anne Arundel County.</p><h2>When the King Was Carpenter</h2><p>Lovely color outdoor photograph of Maria in Austrian dress on back wrapper. &#34;How did this book ever come to be written? So far, all my books have had to do with my family. Well, this one at least began with the family, with one incident, fifty years ago. Little Martina, aged four, didn&#39;t like oatmeal. (As this happened back in Europe, we called it porridge.) She used to spread her helping very thinly all over the plate, hoping to create an &#34;almost finished&#34; impression. In passing by I looked down at her and said, &#39;Martina, the child Jesus would never have done this.&#39; Quick as a wink, she snapped back, &#39;Did He have to eat porridge for breakfast?&#39; To which I had to answer , &#39;I don&#39;t know.&#39; Now the whole little person was sheer interest, &#39;What did He have for breakfast, Mother?&#39; And, embarrassed, again I had to answer, &#39;Really, I don&#39;t know.&#39; Now came the weighty words, &#39;Why don&#39;t you find out?&#39; Her question stuck in me like a dart from then on, And that is the beginning of this book.

Volume Two documents and illustrates all the known sculptures that Lipchitz created during the second half of his long and prolific career, from his arrival in New York on June 13, 1941, until his death on Capri on May 27, 1973. Lipchitz's reputation as one of the masters of modern sculpture has long been based on the great Cubist carvings and bronzes of 1915-25 and on the experimental "transparents" of 1925-30. Although the sculpture from the American years has been widely exhibited, little serious critical attention has been paid to the iconography, the stylistic diversity, the spontaneity and boldness, and the technical innovations of this work. The 403 sculptures cataloged in Volume Two will provide, for the first time, the opportunity to reassess Lipchitz's late work. During the American years commissions occupied more and more of Lipchitz's time and energy. The preparatory studies for each work have been catalogued with the definitive bronze, allowing us to follow the evolution of the projects, from maquettes to monumental sculpture. In contrast to the large scale, public commissions, Lipchitz created the thematic "series" sculptures, which are a unique feature from the second half of his working life. In these intimate, deeply personal works, which he described as "small experimental pieces in which I am exploring new directions and new ideas," Lipchitz gave free rein to his explosive imagination.The authoritative two-volume catalogue raisonne, which will remain the definitive guide to Lipchitz's work, is essential for all those interested in twentieth-century sculpture.</p><p>Alan Wilkinson is a specialist in modern sculpture whose books include <i>The Drawings of Henry Moore, Gauguin to Moore</i>, and <i>Jacques Lipchitz: A Life in Sculpture.</i></p><h2>Bleach Box Set 2: Volumes 22-48 with Premium (Bleach Box Sets)</h2><p>The second Bleach Box Set.

It argued that socialism was impossible as an economic system. It set off two decades of debate, so by the time the essays appeared in English, in this very book here, in 1935, the debate was still raging. This volume edited by F.A. Hayek dug the knife into socialism's heart unlike any book to ever appear. It contains essays by Mises along with a foreword and afterword by Hayek. It also contains more commentary by N.G. Pierson, George Halm, and Enrico Barone. </p><p>It is exceptionally well edited and beautifully argued, and has not been in print for many years. The contents are nothing short of prophetic. </p><p>The so-called "Calculation Argument" has never been answered. It shows that without private property in capital goods, there can be no prices and hence no data available for cost accounting. Production becomes random at best, and completely irrational.

Celebrating this fact, and exploring the spice's fascinating journey from the courts of ancient Crete to the American saffron trade and beyond, <i>Secrets of Saffron</i> offers culinary history in the most interesting way: through great storytelling and compelling personal reminiscence. In prose both refined and direct, Pat Willard tells readers about the ancient gift of the autumn-flowering purple crocus, still gathered by hand from the fields of Iran, Greece, Italy, southern France, and Spain. She also provides ancient and modern recipes featuring saffron--a small collection including a remarkably fragrant Andalusian chicken dish, Saffron Cr�me Br�l�e Pie, and "remedies" like An Excellent Syrup Against Melancholy, one of a number of pharmacological treasures.<p> Though relatively commonplace, saffron remains exotic. Through its history it has comforted (sometimes literally, as a curative) common people (who have often had to gather it) while helping to make Cleopatra alluring; tantalized the highborn in the gardens of Persia; healed Alexander the Great; and driven the crusaders to battle. Ward recounts all this, exploring saffron as world commodity and private passion, finally bringing readers to her own hand-nutured saffron garden in Brooklyn. "One morning," she writes, "the [crocus] blossoms began to unfurl. I gave a yelp, and ran for an old plant saucer, and then I began to pick...." The narrative circle completed, there remains little more for the author to do except to provide readers with a short guide to buying and using saffron, a worthwhile addition. This delightful book should be in the library of everyone interested in food and its almost unfathomable impact on human history. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Pat Willard is author of Pie Every Day and A Soothing Broth.

Readers must decide. Detailed graphic illustrations in muted tones show a boy looking out the window as he rides a train alone. On each left-hand page he is shown gazing out at a new scene. The right-hand page shows a larger version of that scene with dreamlike details that range from historical to bizarre. Dinosaurs scamper across a modern suspension bridge; a man in a toga marches down a hill toward a maze of hedges; wolves enter a castle ground by crawling under a moat as if it were a carpet. Although the boy changes position, he remains in his seat, dressed in the same outfit. Brief captions mention month and location, weather conditions, or the scenery. At the end, dressed in the same suit, the boy, suddenly a white-haired man, leaves the train and, standing at the edge of a cliff, watches smoke from the engine disappear across the sea, the tracks ending abruptly beside him. The book lacks the consistency of successful wordless stories such as Chris Van Allsburg's Ben's Dream (Houghton, 1982) and David Wiesner's Free Fall (Lothrop, 1988). It is more a collection of unusual illustrations that could provide inspiration for creative writers or daydreamers of all ages.<br><i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.A boy takes a train trip and imagines a host of surreal scenarios beyond the window--or is the train trip a metaphor for the artist's journey through life, an interpretation suggested by the substitution, in a final spread, of an old man for the young boy? Billout, perhaps best known for his illustrations in the Atlantic , devises sophisticated visual puzzles in the tradition of David Macaulay's Black and White ; unfortunately, Billout's are more perplexing than provocative. On each spread, the left page presents a partial view through the train window plus a hermetic caption, e.g., "December, or maybe it was August," while the facing page affords the full "view." Thus the boy sees a viaduct; the facing page shows a tyrannosaurus and a triceratops bounding across it. Similarly fantastical panoramas unfold throughout. Although the cryptic captions and the abrupt switch of main characters imply some intellectual agenda, the images seem merely strung together, a collection of curiosities. The audience for this title is hard to discern.

Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.<br>Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.<br>Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.<br>Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2017:</strong> In 2012, author Douglas Preston joined a team of explorers searching for Ciudad Blanca (&#x201c;The White City&#x201d;), a legendary ruin hidden in the dense jungle of eastern Honduras. To this point the city &#x2013; also known as &#x201c;the Lost City of the Monkey God&#x201d; - was literally a legend; while various hucksters and hoaxers had claimed to have discovered the abandoned metropolis, no credible evidence had ever been presented, and its very existence remained shrouded in doubt. In addition to the objective hazards of tropical disease, wild boars, and the deadly fer-de-lance viper, locals stoked the mystique, describing various curses awaiting would-be discoverers. Don&#x2019;t pick the flowers, or you&#x2019;ll die. <p>But this team had an advantage that previous searchers had lacked: LIDAR, an advanced laser-imaging technology able to penetrate the dense jungle canopy &#x2013; just enough &#x2013; and return detailed elevation profiles from which subtle, man-made anomalies could be identified. Almost immediately, two major sites emerged, their scale and architecture indicating a civilization to rival another local, more famous power, the Maya. </p> <p>The announcement had consequences. The fledgling Honduran government, having gained power through a military coup, sought to use the discovery to bolster its status with the population, while the academic community ripped the expedition with accusations of Indiana Jones-style exploitation and shoddy scientific methods, cries which could be uncharitably interpreted as sour grapes. Encroaching deforestation and the prospect of looters created urgency to conduct a ground survey, and the team ventured into the wilderness and all the hazards that awaited, including an unexpected and insidious danger that cursed the team well beyond their return home. </p> <p>The author of over 30 books, including number of bestselling thrillers co-written with Lincoln Child, Preston knows pace, and he packs several narratives into a taut 300 pages. Indiana Jones criticism aside, the story of the discovery and exploration of the ruin is solid adventure writing, and he walks a fine line in dealing with the archaeology community&#x2019;s response, reporting on the bases for their criticism where they chose to provide it. And by invoking Jared Diamond&#x2019;s <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>, Preston speculates on the mysterious, sudden demise of the White City and its inhabitants, drawing ominous parallels between their fate and possibly our own. <em>Lost City</em> is a tale that manages to be both fun and harrowing, a vicarious thrill worthy of a place on the shelf next to David Grann&#x2019;s <em>The Lost City of Z</em>. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em></p>DOUGLAS PRESTON worked as a writer and editor for the American Museum of Natural History and taught writing at Princeton University.

S. Lewis after his death on Nov. 22, 1963. &#34;As a Christian writer his influence was marked: he caught and held the attention of those usually apathetic to religion, of lapsed churchgoers, agnostics:..he made religious books bestsellers and, in a nice sense, fashionable.&#34; This is an imaginative biography that recreates C. S. Lewis&#39;s life with striking impact--a narrative account in which Lewis speaks for himself at almost every moment and incident. A thousand scenes, some very short, all in chronological order, flash by like a video. Better than a feature film, this book brings to life a vivid and multifaceted portrait of Lewis. &#34;He was a poet as contemporary as Auden and a versifier as funny as Gilbert,&#34; Griffin writes. &#34;He was a satirist as slashing as Waugh and a social critic as clever as Coward; he was a scholar as sharp as Leavis and a mythologer as wise as Tolkien. He was a broadcaster with enormous audience and a correspondent of staggering proportion...Emerging from the narrative is an active, energetic man who looked like a farmer but talked like a philosopher, who would as soon lolligag in fairydom as joust in intellectual lists, who relished the love of a woman, and cultivated the love of God.&#34; Long after this book has been read, Lewis&#39;s personality wil linger on, amusing, instructing, inspiring.</p><p>C. S. Lewis (18981963), probably best known for The Screwtape Letters, The Allegory of Love and his children's classic, the Narnia series, was many things: Medieval and Renaissance scholar, novelist, poet, mythologist, satirist, teacher, broadcaster, Christian apologist and one of the influential minds of our time. In this stimulating and imaginative narrative biography, author-playwright Griffin brings before us the man himself, as often as possible via his own words, throughout his long and energetic career at Oxford and Cambridge, particularly in his relations with friends, family, students, critics, editors, thus vividly revealing the warm personality of this keen logician with puckish humor (he once settled a dispute with a student by the sword). There are drawbacks to the method: one doesn't learn the grounds of Lewis's differences with Eliot, for example, or his close friend Tolkien, norfeel the full weight of his mind.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA This long and detailed chronology of Lewis' life will be of particular value as a reference volume but not for recreational reading. It contains an excellent index, notes, and bibliography of works by C. S. Lewis. Numerous scenes from his life, often described in his own words, follow year by year from 1925, when he became a faculty member at Magdalen College (Oxford), to his death in 1963. This is an unemotional and unbiased account of his life and writing that reveals his great intellect and his skill as a writer of fantasy for children and religious books for adults. Through his own struggle with faith, Lewis formulated his beliefs and was always willing to counsel (in person or by letter) other strugglers. The biography reveals him to be a scholar, critic, and prolific writer.

This first book-length biography of Gaine contributes substantially to our knowl�edge of journalism in the Colonial period and provides fascinating insights into life in Revolutionary times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gaine was more than a turncoat Amer�ican, Lorenz shows. From his reading of the files of Gaine&#x2019;s newspaper, from un�published material, and from a wide va�riety of printed sources, Lorenz has pieced together this study of economic and political conservatism, religious be�lief, and social class feelings which made Gaine a prototypal Loyalist to the British cause, though a citizen, or at least a resi�dent, of the United States, to the end of his days, in 1807.</p></p><p><p><b>Alfred Lawrence Lorenz</b> is Associate Professor of Journalism at Marquette University.</p></p><h2>An Introduction to Classical and Contemporary Social Theory</h2><p>This book provides a much needed critical perspective for an analysis of the works of some of the major classical and contemporary social theorists of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
